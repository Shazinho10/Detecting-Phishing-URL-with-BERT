Did we miss something? DM us on Twitter to ask anything else.\nIs registering for a PREMINT list safe?\nYes. Over 1 million list registrations have happened on PREMINT without issue. When you sign in with PREMINT, you only are validating ownership of the wallet address. PREMINT does not get any permissions to perform transactions, and does not have any way of withdrawing anything from your wallet.\nWho else has used PREMINT?\nPremint has been used by some of the top artists and collections in the NFT ecosystem, including XCOPY, Coldie, DeekayMotion, Cool Cats, Known Origin, Async Art, Shaq, and over 1,000 more.\nWhy does PREMINT ask permission to \u201csuggest transactions to approve\u201d when logging in with MetaMask?\nMetaMask\u2019s standard text for anyone connecting their wallet (as of 3/2022) is \u201cSee address, account balance, activity, and suggest transactions to approve.\u201d We don\u2019t have any control over that and you\u2019ll see that message when signing into any site with MetaMask.\nWhy do I need to \u201cSign\u201d a message in addition to connecting my wallet.\nSigning is the only way we can truly know that you are the owner of the wallet you are connecting. Signing is a safe, gas-less transaction that does not in any way give PREMINT permission to perform any transactions with your wallet.\nIf I disconnect my wallet or social networks after registering, will my entry still be valid?\nPREMINT saves your wallet and social info as a part of the registration step, so you can disconnect everything afterwards and your entry is still valid.\nIf I transfer the required NFT after registering, will my registration still be valid?\nAs far as PREMINT is concerned, yes, but the project owner might check that you still own the token before finalizing the list.\nDo you record my IP address?\nWhen you register, we store an encrypted version of your IP address and save it with your registration, but we never save or share your actual IP address and there is no way to get it from what we save.\nI registered, but the project says my wallet isn\u2019t on the list. What happened?\nIf you fully registered, the only way your wallet wouldn\u2019t be on the list of registered wallets is if the project removed it. PREMINT never deletes wallets from the list for any reason.\nIt says my Discord or Twitter are attached to a different wallet.

These movies were altered (for the better) by directors after their cinematic release\nDan Grabham\nFollow @dangrabham\n20 March 2013 / 14:28 GMT16 November 2021 / 16:30 GMT\nOften a film\u2019s director and the studio go head-to-head over what the final cut should look like \u2013 and it\u2019s usually the studio that has the last laugh. But the more bullish director can often turn that to his (or her) advantage by releasing a studio-face-reddening redux that paints those money-hungry suits in a less-than-flickering light. These films \u2013 in no particular order \u2013 are the 25 best director\u2019s cut movies ever.\nNote: All title dates refer to the movie\u2019s original cinematic release, even where the title of the director\u2019s cut differs from the original film\nJFK (1991)\nOliver Stone decided his three-hour treatment of John F Kennedy\u2019s assassination wasn\u2019t long enough, and went back to the cutting room to pick a few extra scenes off the floor. The resulting edit may have added plenty of depth to the story, but did little to quell criticism of historical inaccuracy. Who cares? It was so good, the cinematic release was widely unavailable on home video in favour of the director\u2019s cut.\nPat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973)\nSam Pekinpah and MGM came to blows during the making of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, with the studio re-editing the director\u2019s film into a turkey. Its acclaimed 1988 re-release was of Pekinpah\u2019s original, and it\u2019s a classic with a fatal flaw \u2013 the director had cut star Bob Dylan\u2019s soundtrack jewel, the much-covered Knocking on Heaven\u2019s Door.\nBetty Blue (1986)\nDon\u2019t get us wrong \u2013 the original two-hour version of Betty Blue was superb, but for the full intravenous hit of one of cinematic history\u2019s most intense relationships, the extra hour in the director\u2019s cut is sublime and makes an unmissable French classic even more unmissable. Call it love at second sight.\nDeath Proof (2007)\nTarantino\u2019s Death Proof was double-billed with Planet Terror under the collective title Grindhouse in the US, but released seperately in an extended version overseas, allowing the slasher to stretch its legs under the dashboard, rev the engine and\u2026 well, we won\u2019t spoil it here.\nBlade Runner: The Final Cut (1982)\nOriginally scheduled for a 2002 release, legal disputes meant we didn\u2019t see Blade Runner: The Final Cut until 2007. A good thing, too \u2013 as a result, we got special effects scanned at 8000fps \u2013 four times that used in normal restorations. A scene with a stripper running down the street was actually re-shot twenty years after the original film\u2019s release \u2013 with the original actress.\nAliens: Director\u2019s Cut (1986)\nSeventeen minutes of footage James Cameron found it difficult to cut from the original Aliens is back in Aliens: The Director\u2019s Cut. Originally released on Laserdisc on a limited run, many of us had to wait until the 1999 DVD release. Extra scenes include Ripley in a virtual reality garden, back story about Newt\u2019s family, and a tunnel scene where automated gun turrets vainly try to fend off the alien threat.\nAlexander Revisited: The Final Unrated Cut (2004)\nAlexander the Great was a complicated man. To demonstrate the point Oliver Stone recut Alexander, giving it a longer name \u2013 Alexander Revisted: The Final Unrated Cut \u2013 and, at three and a half hours, a longer running time. It\u2019s actually the third cut of the film, and thankfully features an interval.\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture: Director\u2019s Edition (1979)\nDirector Robert Wise \u201ctightened up\u201d the original with Star Trek: The Motion Picture: Director\u2019s Edition, adding remastered special effects and new audio. Despite being just four minutes longer than the original, many critics argue it\u2019s still too slow for most fast-living sci-fi fans.\nDominion: The Prequel to the Exorcist (2005)\nThis prequel to the 1973\u2019s The Exorcist is the second version of the third Exorcist sequel. Got that? Originally directed by Paul Schrader, the baton was passed to Renny Harlin who pretty much remade it as Exorcist: The Beginning. Fans didn\u2019t like it and demanded Schrader\u2019s version, which was then released. Yeah, it\u2019s complicated.\nTouch of Evil (1958)\nOrson Welles\u2019 classic film noir was chopped to ribbons by Universal before its release \u2013 prompting Welles to write an impassioned 58-page memo detailing the changes he thought needed to be made to the film.\nWelles never lived to see the film restored to his specifications \u2013 but editor Walter Murch used the memo as the basis for a restored version in 1998. It\u2019s as close as we\u2019re going to get to the original Welles cut.\nMetropolis (1927)\nThe most extraordinary director\u2019s cut on this list \u2013 Fritz Lang\u2019s iconic sci-fi film was originally released in a 153-minute cut before being shredded by American distributors. Almost 80 years later, the original cut was rediscovered in an Argentinian museum \u2013 restoring vital subplots and characters excised from the original, including the creepy Thin Man.\nSuperman II: The Richard Donner Cut (1980)\nSuperman II had a troubled production history. Original director Richard Donner was dropped from the film after a dispute with the producers, whereupon Richard Lester stepped in to finish the film \u2013 adding a more comedic tone.\nDonner eventually returned to rework the film, using the footage he\u2019d shot before being dropped from the film alongside some Lester footage \u2013 and even using shots from screen tests. The resulting patchwork is as close as we\u2019re going to get to Donner\u2019s original vision.\nLeon (1994)\nLuc Besson\u2019s thriller about a hitman mentoring a young orphan was pretty dark in its original form. His extended Version Integrale goes to altogether darker places, adding a layer of sexual tension to the relationship between Leon and the 12-year-old Mathilda \u2013 and equally controversial sequences in which Leon trains up his protege as an assassin.\nThe Abyss (1989)\nJames Cameron was forced to drop some tidal wave shots that couldn\u2019t be completed in time for his deep-sea adventure\u2019s initial release. Building on its pioneering CGI work in Cameron\u2019s Terminator 2, effects house Industrial Light and Magic was able to rework the missing shots \u2013 enabling the director to restore a missing subplot dealing with nuclear brinksmanship.\nStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\nGeorge Lucas gets a lot of stick for the Star Wars Special Editions, shoehorning CGI Jabba the Hutts, mugging Boba Fetts and \u2013 most heinously \u2013 Hayden Christensen into the original films. But his extended cut of The Empire Strikes Back is an altogether different beast, with subtle additions that actually enhance the film \u2013 like the CGI windows in Lando Calrissian\u2019s Cloud City, and an extended Wampa attack sequence that makes a good deal more sense than the original version. If only they\u2019d all been like this.\nApocalypse Now Redux (1979)\nFrancis Ford Coppola\u2019s Vietnam war epic gets 49 minutes of (sometimes surreal) extra footage in this slowed down director\u2019s cut \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of minor alterations for film buffs to spot and a new love scene for Willard on a French plantation. The Redux was first screened at Cannes 22 years after the original won the Palme d\u2019Or as a work in progress \u2013 classy move.\nThe Big Red One (1980)\nSeven years after director Samuel Fuller died, this heavily cut World War II film got a long overdue re-release with restored scenes, many of which were featured in Fuller\u2019s companion novel. The Big Red One was the nickname of the US first infantry division and the extended cut delves deeper into the soldiers\u2019 experiences, from catching German infiltrators to sneaking in time for a massage courtesy of a French widow.\nDas Boot (1981)\nThis tense and realistic World War II submarine flick is one of the best German films ever made. The Director\u2019s Cut added an hour of character development to the U-boat action \u2013 director Wolfgang Petersen had so much worthy footage that he also made a five-hour mini-series in 2004. And then thankfully left this masterpiece alone.\nBrazil (1985)\nIt\u2019s not often that sci-fi and satire get on as well as they did in Terry Gilliam\u2019s retro-futuristic Brazil. Gilliam crams even more imaginative visuals and headache inducing dystopian spoof into this slightly longer version of the 1985 film which first appeared in the special Criterion box set.\nAlmost Famous: The Bootleg Cut (2000)\nIf you wish bands were still cool enough to go on tour with, chances are you\u2019ll have fond feelings for Almost Famous. Cameron Crowe\u2019s longer cut restores a scene in which Stillwater get interviewed by a stoned DJ, Lester Bangs and the Rolling Stone journos get more screen time and we get to see William pilfering freebies from motels. Can\u2019t imagine Coldplay nicking the towels from the Wembley Travelodge.\nLord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)\nThe extended edition of The Two Towers adds an extra 43 minutes onto the already impressive three-hour minute running time of the original. Director Peter Jackson himself even makes an appearance, hurling a spear from the battlements of Helm\u2019s Deep towards an onslaught of attacking Uruk-hai. Can\u2019t say that we\u2019d use our directional powers any differently, can you?\nMimic (1997)\nThe director\u2019s cut of Guillermo del Torro\u2019s sci-fi slasher was recut closer to his intended version of the story after Disney sold Miramax. It doesn\u2019t make it any more suitable for those who fear virus-laden cockroaches (or any cockroaches, for that matter).\nKingdom of Heaven (2005)\nThe extended version of Ridley Scott\u2019s epic crusade action extravaganza crams in an extra 45 minutes and is reportedly the version that Scott wanted shown in theatres. It was the usual story of a studio trimming the cinema release to spare moviegoers\u2019 backsides \u2013 only to have them come out demanding their bucks back.\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)\nSpielberg\u2019s Special Edition of his alien encounter masterpiece is actually three minutes shorter than the original, with seven minutes of extra footage replacing 10 minutes of culled material. Notably, you get to see inside the alien mothership. It netted an extra US$15.7 million at the box office \u2013 not too shabby, Mr Spielberg.\nI Am Legend (2007)\nThe alternate ending of Francis Lawrence\u2019s take on the 1964 novel The Last Man on Earth (we won\u2019t spoil it here) is preferred by most movie fans, despite the Hollywood hunch that we\u2019re all gluttons for cloying closure over original storylines. Worth watching again if you\u2019ve only seen the original.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookPinterestLinkedInWhatsApp\nRelated content\nFeatures\n60 best hi-fi audiophile albums ever\nIf your ears, speakers and headphones need a proper workout, you should start with one of these records.

Even those who have been playing for decades still find room to learn. In this article, we will cover the basics of Contract Bridge, including bidding, playing, and scorekeeping. After you understand the rules for Contract Bridge, you can learn some of the variations like Auction Bridge, Honeymoon Bridge, Reverse Bridge, and Three-Handed Bridge. Let's begin with the rules of bidding in Contract Bridge:Number of players: Four, playing as two pairs, with partners facing each other. Tradition refers to the pairs as North-South and East-West.Object: Following an auction, to score points by taking tricks during the play and to eventually win a rubber of two games.The cards: Each deal requires a regular 52-card deck. It's customary to keep a second pack ready for the next hand.To play: After all the cards have been dealt out, dealer begins the auction (also called the bidding). When the bidding is over, the play of the hand starts. The play comprises 13 tricks in all.Understanding the bidding: Most games with auctions or bids use a brief and simple procedure. Bridge is special in allowing players to have a creative and complex auction.\nIn the diagrammed deal, West deals and passes, and North opens the bidding 1.\nEast passes. South bids 2. West passes. North bids 3 and, after East passes,\nSouth bids 6. This is a bid to take 12 out of the 13 tricks on the hand, which South\nexpects to happen. The next three players all pass. South, the first to bid s for the\nwinning bidders, becomes declarer at a contract of 6.In Bridge, players on both sides bid for their side's right to choose the trump suit or to play the hand at NT (no-trump). The dealer starts the bidding. A bid is a number 1-7 plus a suit (, , , , or NT). The number, added to six, indicates how many tricks your side is to take with the suit bid as trumps.Each time it's your turn, you may bid or pass (make no bid). Simply put, if you can manage to win the bid at a suit in which your side has more cards than the other side has, it will greatly help in winning tricks.\nUseful Bridge TermsHere's a quick reference for some of the card language you will find in this article.Auction: bidding for number of tricks to be taken in the gameContract: number of tricks declarer must take to satisfy his or her bidDeclarer: winner of the auction, the player who tries to make the contractDummy: declarer's partner; the dummy hand is laid face up on the tableDouble: in the auction a bid to double the score or the penalties if a contract is made or setMajor: a heart or spade cardMinor: a diamond or club cardNot vulnerable: a side that has not won a game yet in a rubber.Overcall: a bid made after opponents have opened the biddingRaise: a bid in a suit that partner has already bidRebid: your second bidRedouble: doubling a doubleResponse: your call in the auction when your partner has opened the biddingRubber: two gamesRuff: to trumpSet: to defeat a contractSingleton: just one card of a suitTable: the dummyUndertricks: number of tricks the declaring side falls short of the contractVoid: no cards in a suitVulnerable: a side that has won a game in a rubberFor a complete listing of card terminology, click here.The lowest bid, 1, is a contract your side would fulfill by taking at least 7 tricks with clubs as trumps. Similarly, 1 indicates 7 tricks with diamonds as trumps; 3 means 9 tricks with diamonds as trumps; 3 NT means 9 tricks with no suit as trumps.The bidding can start with any opening bid. During the auction, players in turn may pass or bid (or in frequent cases, may double or redouble). Each new bid must be higher than the previous bid. The new bid may be in a higher-ranking suit without increasing the number of tricks: s rank lowest, followed by , , , and NT. The easiest way to remember the suit ranking is that the four suits rank alphabetically, and NT ranks the highest of all. (In Bridge, s and s are called majors; s and s are called minors). Or, if you go to a higher number of tricks, you can bid in any suit or NT.The auction ends as soon as three players in a row pass. The last bid becomes the final contract. Whichever partner first bid the winning trump suit is called the declarer. (In the hand above, South becomes the declarer because he bid s before North). By the way, don't let any other player see your cards during the auction.Double and redouble: If your opponent has made the most recent bid, at your turn you may double (just say the word \"double\"). This means you double the stakes, i.e., if you make your contract, you win double the number of points -- your risk is also correspondingly greater. Either opponent can then redouble. Three passes end every auction, so it's quite possible for the final contract to be doubled or redoubled, increasing the score. Bidding Strategies: When you are first learning to play bridge, determining what to bid can be confusing. As you continue to play, you will quickly learn that making an intelligent bid is key to winning the game. It will take a lot of practice to understand all the nuances of bidding, and we won't get into any of the fine points here -- whole books have been written about bidding strategies!\u00a0 However, to help you get started, here are some basic guidelines to help you develop your bidding skills. Arrange your hand according to suit. Now assign points to your cards in the following way: Aces, 4 points; kings, 3 points; queens, 2 points; jacks, 1 point; singleton (only one card in a suit), 1 point; void (no cards in a suit), 2 points. Add up your points. Now\nlook at your cards to determine which is your strongest suit. To bid a\nsuit as trump, you'll want to have 4-5 of the suit with a minimum of 1-2 high cards. If you have 16-18 points and a fairly even distribution of cards\nin each suit, you may consider bidding no trump. The general rule of thumb is to open a bid (to bid first on your team) only if you have 13 or more points. Of course, it's a different story if your partner has already bid because he is signaling to you that he already has sufficient points to open. In that case he is asking you if you can support his suit or if you have another suit you'd like to introduce. In answering your partner's opening bid, you should have at least 6-8 points to support his suit and 8-10 if you're introducing a new suit. On the other hand, if your partner has passed and you don't have 13 points, it may be wise for you to pass as well.As you and your partner bid back and forth, try to ascertain how many points you have as a team. For instance, if you believe that your partner's points and your points combine to total 28 or more, you should have enough to take a bid of 4. For a bid of 6, 33 points should suffice, and for a bid of 7 (a \"grand slam\"), you should have 36 points between you. There are numerous other point-counting conventions, but these cover some of the essentials.Of course, every rule has some exceptions, and you must also pay attention to your opponents' bidding. You may find that they're bidding a suit that is particularly strong in your hand. Then you have to decide, based on what your partner has bid and your own points, whether it would be a better strategy to allow your opponents' bid to go through and try to set them or try to win the contract yourself and thus earn game points.Now that you understand the rules and strategies for the auction portion of Contract Bridge, you're ready to read about playing the hand.\nAdvertisement\nContents\nContract Bridge Play\nContract Bridge Scoring\nAuction, Honeymoon, Reverse and Three-Handed Bridge\nContract Bridge Play\nOnce the bidding portion of Contract Bridge has been completed, the play of the hand begins. Let's look at the rules of play:The play of the hand: The player at declarer's left (in the sample hand below, West) will\nchoose the card to lead to the first trick. This is called the opening\nlead. Once the opening lead is made, the dummy hand, (that of\ndeclarer's partner, here North), is placed on the table. The declarer's partner is now functionally out of the round, as this hand is now played by the declarer. South\nrearranges the dummy hand to show trumps (s) on the left, as illustrated here:\nWhen it is dummy's turn to play, declarer selects the card to be played and plays itor asks dummy to play what the declarer selects. Each hand in playing to a trick\u00a0must follow with a card of the suit led, but lacking that suit may play any card.Whichever hand wins a trick will lead any card to the next trick. Once the opening card has been led, each player must follow suit if able. Should you be deficient in the suit led, you are free to play any other card, including trump. High trump or highest card in the suit led wins the trick. The winner of each trick leads to the next. If the trick is won by a card from the dummy\u00b9s hand (or \"board\"), the next trick must be led from the board. \u00a0The first time trump is played, trump is said to be broken. Only after trump has been broken may anyone lead with a trump -- unless they have no other suits available. \u00a0Here is a sample round using the hands introduced on the first page:\nWest begins by leading the 5. South wins East's J with the A.\nAt tricks two and three, South cashes (takes short tricks) his A and K, and discovers that the defense will win a trick with the Q (meaning that West threw out their J and 2, leaving the Q in reserve for later use).\nSouth continues at the fourth trick by leading the 3 to dummy's K.\nSouth leads 3 to the dummy's K.\nSouth next leads the 10, West puts on the Q, but South trumps it in dummy with dummy's remaining trump.\nExcept for West's high , South will win all the tricks and the contract succeeds.\nThis is the sample Bridge hand shown earlier. Now that you've\nread about the bidding and playing of a hand, you'll need to learn about keeping score. Let's take a look at the Contract Bridge socring system on the next page.\nAdvertisement\nContract Bridge Scoring\nThe\nbidding and play of Contract Bridge were covered on the first two pages. Now\nyou will learn the rules of keeping score, which can take some getting used to:Scoring:\nAfter the tricks have been played, it is clear whether the declarer\nmade the contract (i.e., took at least the number of tricks bid for)\nor, instead, went down. If the contract is made, the declaring side\nscores according to the table below. If you make a contract of 6, it's\ncalled a small slam; a grand slam is a made contract of 7 bids. Both\nslams receive bonuses. If you win six or seven tricks but did not bid\nthat number; you are not credited with a slam.\nThese are the scores allotted \"below the line\" for contracts that have been won.If\nthe contract goes down, the other side scores points for undertricks,\nthat is, the number of tricks the declaring side falls short of the\ncontract (see chart below).\nIf the contract goes down, the other side scores points\u00a0for undertricks according to the chart above.Rubber Bridge scoring:\nWhen one side has scored two games, it wins the rubber. A game means\n100 points in tricks bid for (and won) according to the scoring table above. It's quite possible to bid and make game on a single deal: For\nexample, 3 NT scores 100 points, and successful contracts of 4, 4, 5, and 5\nalso count at least 100 points. Alternatively, you can earn game in a\nseries of deals whose final contracts end at a lower bidding level;\nthese are called part-scores or partials. For example, you might bid\nand make 2 on one hand (40 points), and on the next hand you might bid and make 2 (60 points). The two added together equal 100 points, enough for game.A\nside that has scored one game is vulnerable, so if both sides have a\ngame both are vulnerable. A side that hasn't scored a game yet is not\nvulnerable. When defenders defeat, or set, a contract, they earn\ngreater points whenever the other side is vulnerable. Score for the\nwinning side is also increased when the final contract is doubled or\nredoubled. Note: Extra tricks (overtricks) made at any contract do not\ncount toward game.Scoring above and below the line: Both sides usually keep score, either on a preprinted Bridge score pad, or else just by drawing lines in a cross.\nContract scores are separated from\u00a0undertrick,overtrick and bonus points by a line.Points\ntoward game go below the line, while all other points, including\nbonuses and overtricks, score above the line. In the diagram to the right, E-W bid\n1NT and made 2NT, scoring 40 below the line and 30 above for the\novertrick. Then N-S bid 4\nand made 120. To show that a game was won, an additional line was added\nunder that score. E-W's 40 part-score, by the way, is wiped out, E-W\nearn the points but both sides start fresh earning 100 trick points\ntoward the next game. N-S then bid 3 but went down one vulnerable, earning E-W 100 above the line. Finally, N-S bid and made 6\n(in the hand shown), scoring 180 below the line in trick score, 750\nabove the line for vulnerable small slam bonus, and 700 more points\nabove the line for winning a rubber two games to none. In this\ninstance, the total rubber score is N-S 1,750, E-W 170. Below is a list of scoring for bonuses and overtricks.\nOvertricks, honors and other additional bonus points. Tips and strategy:\nRemembering the cards played is one key to improving your play. This\nwill occur over time. As a start, make sure to notice and remember the\nfirst time someone doesn't follow to a trick. It also helps to\ndevelop an ease with the number 13. That's the number of cards in a\nsuit, the number or cards each player is dealt, and the number of\ntricks in the play. More books have been written on Bridge than on\nany other card game, so go to the library or bookstore and explore the\nbidding styles and tips for good card-play.Contract Bridge is a\ncomplex game with many layers of strategy, but once you get the hang of\nit, you can play it for life. On the next page, we'll introduce you\nsome variations -- Auction Bridge, Honeymoon Bridge, Reverse Bridge and\nThree-Handed Bridge.\nAdvertisement\nAuction, Honeymoon, Reverse and Three-Handed Bridge\nYou\nnow have a good idea how to play Contract Bridge, the most popular\nversion of bridge. Let's take a look at some other bridge variations --\nAuction, Honeymoon, Reverse and Three-Handed Bridge:Auction BridgeAuction Bridge had its heyday from about 1900 to 1930, before yielding to Contract Bridge.Number of players: FourObject: To\nscore points. In Auction Bridge, if you take enough tricks, you score\ngame and slam bonuses without regard to how high the bidding ended.The cards: Regular pack 52-card deck.To play:\nThe auction, procedure of play, and rules of play are already described\nin Contract Bridge on the first page of this article. Only the scoring\nchanges in Auction Bridge.Scoring:\nAuction Bridge underwent several scoring changes, and this is the final\nversion. A rubber ends when one side scores two games. Game is 30\npoints in trick-score: ,, , ,\nand NT score 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 points per trick, scored below the\nline. When one side reaches 30, both sides start anew on the next game.\nWinning the rubber (two games) earns a 250-point bonus.Winning\n12 of 13 tricks earns a 50-point small slam bonus, and winning all 13\ntricks (a grand slam) receives a 100-point reward. Making doubled or\nredoubled contracts doubles or redoubles the trick-score. Overtricks\n(extra tricks made) at a doubled contract count 50 each, and redoubled\novertricks are 100 each. Failing to make a contract costs 50 per trick\nundoubled, 100 doubled, and 200 redoubled. Bonuses are given to hands\nthat contain any of the following: 3 of top 5 honors (A, K, Q, J, and\n10 of trump) or 3 aces at NT (may be divided between hands), 30 points;\n4 honors or 4 aces at NT (divided), 40 points; 5 trump honors divided,\n50 points; 4 trump honors in one hand, 80 points; 4 trump honors in one\nhand, with 5th in partner's hand, 90 points; 4 aces in one hand (at\nNT), 100 points; 5 honors in one hand, 100 points.Tips:\nThe bidding in Auction is less sophisticated than in Contract Bridge,\nsince the main idea is to buy the contract at a low level. But you\nmight not have found the best suit for your side.Look to take as many tricks as you can, since the possibility of winning a game or slam is alive on every hand. Honeymoon BridgeThis is one of the most popular two-player Bridge variants.Number of Players: TwoTo play:\nThis is a great game for honeymooners and other couples. Players sit\nnext to (not opposite) each other. Dealer deals out four hands,\nincluding a dummy hand for each player. Deal each dummy hand as\nfollows: First, deal out two rows of three cards face down. Then place\none card face up on top of each face-down card. Deal the last card face\nup next to the rows.Bid as in normal Bridge, except that a\nsingle pass ends the auction. The play goes this way, with each player\ncontrolling the cards played from the partner/dummy hand across the\ntable: The hand at declarer's left makes the opening lead. Players\nselect the cards played only from among the exposed cards in their\ndummy hands. After the trick is finished, turn up any uncovered card in\ntheir dummy. Any newly revealed card may now be played.Reverse BridgeThis four-handed game turns all the rules upside-down!To play:\nRules and play are as in regular Bridge, but the object is entirely the\nopposite: You try to force opponents to take the tricks for the bid you\nmake. So, if your side wins a final contract of 4, your job is to get your opponents to take at least 10 of 13 tricks with s as trumps. You get the score for any contract you force the opponents to make.Strategy:\nInstead of saving the high cards your side holds to play on different\ntricks, as in regular Bridge, you'll play as high a card as you can\nthat you think will still lose a trick. When your side does take a\ntrick, try to put high cards on it from both hands so that you can save\nyour losing cards to help you later in the hand!Three-Handed BridgeWaiting\nfor a fourth player to show up, lots of folks have sought ways for only\nthree players to enjoy Bridge. Though no method comes close to the real\nthing, here's one way to have some fun.Number of players: ThreeTo play:\nDeal out four hands, with the fourth hand (which will become a dummy)\nleft on the table opposite the dealer with four cards turned up.\nPlayers will bid for the right to become declarer opposite the dummy on\nthe table, and play out the contract against the two other players, who\nwill defend.Dealer begins the bidding, and the final contract\nis agreed to after two passes. Shift places, if needed, to bring\ndeclarer opposite the dummy hand.After the opening lead, turn up the face-down dummy cards to let declarer see the dummy before planning a line of play.Scoring:\nThe scoring is the same as in Contract Bridge, but it can get a little\ncomplicated keeping track of three scores. A contract may be doubled\nand redoubled, but that applies to the scores of only the two players\ninvolved. The third scores for an undoubled contract.You've\nlearned how to play two variations on four-handed bridge as well as\nversions for two and three players. Now there's no limit to developing your bridge skills -- you'll be an impressive player before you know it!\nAdvertisement\nBridge Game FAQ\nHow many players are there in bridge?\nFour, playing as two pairs, with partners facing each other. Tradition refers to the pairs as North-South and East-West.\nHow do you win bridge?\nEach partnership tries to score points by bidding, or by defeating the opposing partnership's bid.

In going by the book, everything turns out predictable and never takes any risk. Ironically, taking no risks was a huge risk by itself, almost a guarantee that it was going to be a failure. That is a shame, given that this is a very valuable story that appeals to today's society even if laws have \"changed\".\nWhat the film does good, however, is to transmit its main message despite its one-sided nature, and to deliver solid performances. It had been easy to forecast positive stardom light for Viola Davis' future since she stole everybody's breath with one single scene in Doubt (2009) with spectacular talent. It is no surprise, therefore, that she was given the opportunity to have a leading role in a thematic drama, and she does a job that defied expectations along with a very talented cast despite the flat characters. Octavia Spencer is the second highlight, delivering lines with style and good timing, and light humor in a refreshing way. Both actresses know the importance of acting, both in the terms of \"transmitting\" and \"reacting\".\nEasy Oscar bait that ignores the importance of the so-called \"developent\" of civil rights and the important black figures that propelled such revolutionary movement (but conveniently referencing it briefly), the events and the content of the film are forgettable, but not its story nor its black characters, who keep suffering today.\n55/100\nEdgar C\nSuper Reviewer\nNov 13, 2013\nAside from the last fifteen minutes which *really* pile on the treacly sentimentality, this is a pretty decent adaptation of a very good book, with a smashing performance from Jessica Chastain.\nDaniel P\nSuper Reviewer\nOct 11, 2013\nThe Help is aided by strong personalities but ultimately falls short of being a great picture with overly sentimental moments and a slight glossing over of a tragic period in American life.\nJohn B\nSuper Reviewer\nSee All Audience reviews\nMovie & TV guides\nView All\nMost Anticipated 2023 Movies\nTV Premiere Dates 2023\nBest Horror Movies of 2022\nBest TV & Streaming 2022\nALL CRITICS\nTOP CRITICS\nVERIFIED AUDIENCE\nALL AUDIENCE\nAbout Tomatometer\nAbout Audience Score\nClose video\nSee Details\nSee Details\nHelp\nAbout Rotten Tomatoes\nWhat's the Tomatometer\u00ae?\nCritic Submission\nLicensing\nAdvertise With Us\nCareers\nJOIN THE NEWSLETTER\nGet the freshest reviews, news, and more delivered right to your inbox!\nJoin the Newsletter!\nJoin the Newsletter!\nFollow Us\nCopyright \u00a9 Fandango.

        "legitimate": "Writing Graphic Design Resumes. Step by step to an effective graphic design CV .\nEffective Graphic Design Resumes - How to Write a CV and Increase Your Chances of Graphic Design Employment\nGraphic Design Resumes Introduction\nTake a Step Back\nStructure and Presentation\nContent\nMake a Start\nImportant points\nGot the interview? What next?\nMore Information and Tips\nIntroduction\nWhen writing graphic design resumes over the years, I've read plenty of \"How to Write a CV\" books, and one thing above all has struck me in the introductory pages. More often than not, the author begins by explaining what a minefield it can be to write your own CV, and goes on to say how much of a shame it is that there are so many so-called experts out there giving bad advice about writing CVs. Then they produce their own book full of their own opinions on the subject.\nI'm not going to begin by rubbishing other authors. I am grateful for the proliferation of differing opinions on the subject. It's enabled me to come to balanced conclusions about how to write an effective CV. My opinions are based on what I've read about CV creation, graphic design resumes I have written and graphic design CVs that have been sent to me as a potential employer.\nInstead of my asking you to trawl through many diverse methods of graphic design resume writing, it's my intention to give you an idea of what I believe to be a good format. It's highly flexible and can be customised to suit the position you want to win.\nGraphic Design Resumes\nTake a Step Back\nThe Latin \"Curriculum Vitae\" means: \"The way your life has run\". The French \"Resume\" means \"Summary\". Start with this in mind. The CV is a summary of YOUR working life, no one else's. Consider carefully what you'll include in a CV and how it'll look. Most people know roughly what a CV should contain, and that's enough for them. They throw everything they think might be vaguely relevant into it, often using other people's CVs (not just graphic design resumes) as a guide to graphic design resume writing. Your CV is your first impression. Make it a good one. The person charged with the task of selecting a short list of possible candidates has probably seen every line in the book. \"I work well individually and as part of a team\" is a very popular line. It has become almost as predictably present on the average CV as the dark lines left by a poor quality photocopy on cheap paper.\nIf you're responding to a recruitment ad, read it very carefully. Has it been thrown together in a hurry, or is it professionally designed? You can learn a lot about the advertiser by studying their adverts. Make sure you make careful note of exactly how to respond. Some specifically say \"no resumes\" and instead require an application form to be filled out. Others want your covering letter to be hand written. This will be time well spent, as it's often the case that a candidate is so pleased to find a recruitment advert that suits them that they forget to read the details and rush off a hastily prepared letter and CV, no matter what's required of them.\nFind out as much about the company you are applying to as possible. Is this job really for you? The purpose of your CV is primarily to highlight your potential value to the company. It could also be used to provide material for an interview. If you are not confident that the job is right for you, it'll be picked up very quickly.\nConsider what experience you have that will help you do the job well. I have found that a good and fast way to find out about a company is to visit their web site (if it exists). There's often a wealth of information available, and possibly details about the person you're writing to. It's always helpful to be in possession of more information than you might need, particularly at the interview stage.\nWhen writing, try to think of what the reader's reaction will be. Try to sell them what you think they want to buy. This doesn't mean to say that you should be untruthful; it means that you should tailor your CV to your audience. Make the most of the information relevant to them, but don't over-egg the pudding. If you give yourself more credit than you deserve, it'll bite back if you get an interview when you are asked you to elaborate.\nGraphic Design Resumes\nStructure and Presentation\nThe layout of your CV should be concise, informative, easy-to-read and printed on good quality paper. If the reader has a pile of graphic design resumes to read, they don't want to spend more time than necessary plodding through your reams of beautifully written prose. Use short sentences and don't go off at a tangent. Left justify your type, and whichever font you use, decide on a style and stick with it throughout. There's nothing more off-putting than a document filled with different fonts, text sizes, colours and alignments. And if the job you want is as a graphic designer, there's more pressure to make your presentation appealing.\nAvoid gimmicks like brightly coloured paper, or a CV folded into the shape of an aeroplane. They may provide a few moments of light relief for the reader, but it is generally accepted that it's the content that gets you the job, not your ability to be different. Recruitment is a serious business and should be treated as such. Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule, and the employer might specifically request an \"off the wall\" resume if it's relevant to a creative job. However, I can't remember the last time I saw such a request!\nAs a graphic design employer, I want to be confident that any prospective graphic designer knows what looks good on a page. I also want to know that they have a good feeling for presentation. I've seen it all - illegible graphic design resumes accompanied by hastily written scraps of notepaper covered in coffee, CDs full of Quicktime movies of off-the-wall college projects, traced pictures of Goofy (yes, Goofy)... none of these work for me.\nPersonally, I want to see clean, correctly spelled, easy-to-read graphic design resumes, and if there are any good quality, appropriate pieces of artwork from a portfolio, they can be a clincher. As for a covering letter, please avoid letting on that your intention is to learn as much as possible from your new employer before leaving and setting up your own studio in direct competition! It happens time and time again, and it's a bit of a turn-off!\nGraphic Design Resumes\nContent for Your Graphic Design CV\nThere are two basic resume layouts I'll mention here - it's up to you to make them your own. In my opinion the traditional \"Tombstone\" format of CV is out of date and should be avoided - the references to religion and national insurance numbers suggest that it might be more suitable for someone who wants to apply for a job sometime in the 1960s! Its order of contents goes something like this:\nName\nOccupation\nAddress\nTelephone Number\nDate of Birth\nPlace of Birth\nNationality\nMarital Status\nNext of Kin\nHealth\nDriving License\nReligion\nNational Insurance Number\nSecondary Education\nHigher Education\nProfessional Qualifications\nEmployment History (chronological)\nOther (interests, achievements)\nThis format follows a more concise structure, and is what we'll focus on:\nName\nAddress\nTelephone\nDate of Birth\nCareer profile\nCareer and achievements to date\nProfessional qualifications and training\nTertiary education\nSecondary education\nPersonal information\nThe main difference between the two approaches is that in the second example, relevant work experience is brought to the fore. The reader will be presented with the information of interest straight off the bat. Education is, of course, very important, but actual work experience is always given more weight. If your employment history is left to the end, the reader has to crunch through everything else before they find the information that is instrumental in getting you to the next stage.\nGraphic Design Resumes\nMake a Start\nName, Address, Telephone, (e-mail address)To begin with, your name and contact details should be laid out in a balanced block, either ranged left or centred. Avoid putting this information in more than one column unless you're confident that you can make it appear ordered and easy to read - and if it's a graphic design job you're after, this should pose no problem!\nGraphic Design Resumes\nCareer Profile\nSpend some time preparing a brief career summary using 20 to 30 words. This should encapsulate your key skills, your attitude to work, your career aspirations and the experience you have gained thus far - a mission statement.\nUse short sentences. Be brief, concise and avoid clich\u00e9s. Although this synopsis will be short, you should spend some time getting it just right. It'll also help with the rest of the resume's content. All the information in your CV should reinforce and complement your career summary. Avoid the use of the first person. Use the past tense, not the present.\nGraphic Design Resumes\nCareer and Achievements to Date\nYour jobs should be listed (with dates of employment) in reverse chronological order. This ensures the reader is presented with the most relevant information first. Use short sentences and avoid the use of the first person. If possible, show your career path advancing towards a peak. For example, if you are applying for a graphic design position the reader would be impressed to see previous jobs showing your advance from Junior Designer to Project Manager to Creative Director. This shows that you're committed to your profession - you're progressing towards a clear goal.\nIf your career path shows that you have taken career breaks' and jumped from one type of job to another, it could paint an unreliable picture. Always accentuate the positive in any situation. If you've taken a career break, highlight what you have learned and show that you're ready to return to work. Only mention salary if asked and don't mention reasons for leaving your job; leave those details for later.\nOnly include McDonalds-type-jobs if they are all the experience you've had. If they are, you'll have some convincing to do with your portfolio. Build it up with case-study projects (they don't have to be real) that are marketable, like stationery and advert designs. Don't fill your portfolio with vast amounts of contemporary, free-form college work - it doesn't sell!\nFocus on your achievements more than responsibilities. What have your successes been? How did you succeed, and in what way did they benefit your employer? If you have had little or no job experience of relevance to the position for which you are applying, emphasise the experience you've gained from any relevant education you've received.\nGraphic Design Resumes\nEducation and Graphic Design Training\nProfessional training such as graphic design degrees or qualifications should be listed at the top of this section, because it's likely to be more relevant to the reader. Include dates and brief details of what was covered in the courses you took. Next, list any higher education you received followed by secondary education, including the names of the school, college or university. Include no more than two secondary schools, and don't go into endless detail about your exam results - just list them in a well-formatted way, showing the most relevant passes first.\nGraphic Design Resumes\nPersonal information\nIn this brief section, create the impression of diversity. Balance your indoor interests with outdoor activities, and if they relate in some way to your work, so much the better. Don't over exaggerate! If you have a full driving license, mention it if you think it'll be relevant.\nGraphic Design Resumes\nImportant Points\nDon't mention your health unless necessary; the employer will assume you are in good shape! As for referees, add them if you feel they will be able to give relevant, positive information to any prospective boss. The more relevant the better.\nDon't mention your current salary on your CV unless specifically asked. At this stage you're in a very weak bargaining position - the time to discuss salary is after you have been through the interview and you're offered a job, when your position is stronger. After making an offer your new employers will know that they will have to go through the entire selection process from scratch if they don't hold on to you!\nIt may sound obvious, but check your spelling and grammar! Bad spelling usually indicates one of the following: the author can't spell, is too lazy to spell correctly, is inattentive to detail or simply doesn't care. Any one of these spells \"rejection\". I work in a business that demands good grammar and spelling from its graphic designers. Our job involves not only graphic design skills, but also a working knowledge of proofreading and copy editing. Nevertheless, I estimate that only one in ten graphic design resumes sent to my studio is free of spelling and grammatical errors. Even when the graphic designer's resume is fine, if the covering letter contains even the slightest mistake it ruins the effect! It's a waste of time to send a poorly prepared CV and covering letter.\nSo you got yourself an interview! How best to get through it?\nNow you've written the perfect graphic design CV and got an interview for a graphic design job, what's the best way to convince the prospective boss to hire you?

Blackletter is sometimes referred to as Old English, but it is not to be confused with the Old English language, which predates blackletter by many centuries and was written in the insular script or in Futhorc. Along with Italic type and Roman type, blackletter served as one of the major typefaces in the history of Western typography.\nContents\n1 Origins\n2 Etymology\n3 Forms\n3.1 Textura\n3.2 Schwabacher\n3.3 Fraktur\n3.4 Cursiva\n3.5 Hybrida\n3.6 Donatus-Kalender\n4 Blackletter typesetting\n5 National forms\n5.1 England\n5.1.1 Textualis\n5.1.2 Cursiva\n5.2 France\n5.2.1 Textualis\n5.2.2 Cursiva\n5.3 Germany\n5.3.1 Textualis\n5.3.2 Cursiva\n5.4 Italy\n5.4.1 Rotunda\n5.4.2 Cursiva\n5.5 The Netherlands\n5.5.1 Textualis\n6 Unicode\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 Further reading\n10 External links\nOrigins[edit]\nPage from a 14th-century psalter (Vulgate Ps 93:16\u201321), with blackletter \"sine pedibus\" text.

New universities were founded, each producing books for business, law, grammar, history and other pursuits, not solely religious works, for which earlier scripts typically had been used.\nVarious German language blackletter typefaces\nEnglish blackletter typefaces highlighting differences between select characters\nModern interpretation of blackletter script in the form of the font \"Old English\" which includes several anachronistic glyphs, such as Arabic numerals, ampersand (instead of Tironian et) and several punctuation marks, but lacks letter alternatives like long \u27e8s\u27e9 and \u27e8r\u27e9 rotunda, scribal abbreviations and ligatures, and contains several relatively modern versions of letters such as \u27e8x\u27e9, which is confusable with the letter \u27e8r\u27e9.\nThese books needed to be produced quickly to keep up with demand. Labor-intensive Carolingian, though legible, was unable to effectively keep up.[citation needed] Its large size consumed a lot of manuscript space in a time when writing materials were very costly. As early as the 11th century, different forms of Carolingian were already being used, and by the mid-12th century, a clearly distinguishable form, able to be written more quickly to meet the demand for new books,[citation needed] was being used in northeastern France and the Low Countries.\nEtymology[edit]\nPage of a rare blackletter Bible, 1497, printed in Strasbourg by Johann Gr\u00fcninger, then one of the city's most prolific printers. The red chapter initials were handwritten by a rubricator after printing.\nThe term Gothic was first used to describe this script in 15th-century Italy, in the midst of the Renaissance, because Renaissance humanists believed this style was barbaric, and Gothic was a synonym for barbaric. Flavio Biondo, in Italia Illustrata (1474), wrote that the Germanic Lombards invented this script after they invaded Italy in the 6th century.\nNot only were blackletter forms called Gothic script, but any other seemingly barbarian script, such as Visigothic, Beneventan, and Merovingian, were also labeled Gothic. This in contrast to Carolingian minuscule, a highly legible script which the humanists called littera antiqua (\"the ancient letter\"), wrongly believing that it was the script used by the ancient Romans. It was in fact invented in the reign of Charlemagne, although only used significantly after that era, and actually formed the basis for the later development of blackletter.[4]\nBlackletter script should not be confused with either the ancient alphabet of the Gothic language nor with the sans-serif typefaces that are also sometimes called Gothic.\nForms[edit]\nTextura[edit]\nTextualis, also known as textura or Gothic bookhand, was the most calligraphic form of blackletter, and today is the form most associated with \"Gothic\". Johannes Gutenberg carved a textualis typeface\u00a0\u2013 including a large number of ligatures and common abbreviations\u00a0\u2013 when he printed his 42-line Bible. However, textualis was rarely used for typefaces after this.\nAccording to Dutch scholar Gerard Lieftinck, the pinnacle of blackletter use was reached in the 14th and 15th centuries. For Lieftinck, the highest form of textualis was littera textualis formata, used for de luxe manuscripts. The usual form, simply littera textualis, was used for literary works and university texts. Lieftinck's third form, littera textualis currens, was the cursive form of blackletter, extremely difficult to read and used for textual glosses, and less important books.\nTextualis was most widely used in France, the Low Countries, England, and Germany. Some characteristics of the script are:\nTall, narrow letters, as compared to their Carolingian counterparts.\nLetters formed by sharp, straight, angular lines, unlike the typically round Carolingian; as a result, there is a high degree of \"breaking\", i.e. lines that do not necessarily connect with each other, especially in curved letters.\nAscenders (in letters such as \u27e8b\u27e9, \u27e8d\u27e9, \u27e8h\u27e9) are vertical and often end in sharp finals\nWhen a letter with a bow (in \u27e8b\u27e9, \u27e8d\u27e9, \u27e8p\u27e9, \u27e8q\u27e9) is followed by another letter with a bow (such as \u27e8be\u27e9 or \u27e8po\u27e9), the bows overlap and the letters are joined by a straight line (this is known as \"biting\").\nA related characteristic is the half r (also called r rotunda), the shape of \u27e8r\u27e9 when attached to other letters with bows; only the bow and tail were written, connected to the bow of the previous letter. In other scripts, this only occurred in a ligature with the letter \u27e8o\u27e9.\nSimilarly related is the form of the letter \u27e8d\u27e9 when followed by a letter with a bow; its ascender is then curved to the left, like the uncial \u27e8d\u27e9. Otherwise the ascender is vertical.\nThe letters \u27e8g\u27e9, \u27e8j\u27e9, \u27e8p\u27e9, \u27e8q\u27e9, \u27e8y\u27e9, and the hook of \u27e8h\u27e9 have descenders, but no other letters are written below the line.\nThe letter a has a straight back stroke, and the top loop eventually became closed, somewhat resembling the number \u27e88\u27e9. The letter s often has a diagonal line connecting its two bows, also somewhat resembling an \u27e88\u27e9, but the long s is frequently used in the middle of words.\nMinims, especially in the later period of the script, do not connect with each other. This makes it very difficult to distinguish \u27e8i\u27e9, \u27e8u\u27e9, \u27e8m\u27e9, and \u27e8n\u27e9. A 14th-century example of the difficulty minims produced is: mimi numinum niuium minimi munium nimium uini muniminum imminui uiui minimum uolunt ('the smallest mimes of the gods of snow do not wish at all in their life that the great duty of the defenses of wine be diminished'). In blackletter, this would look like a series of single strokes. As a result, dotted \u27e8i\u27e9 and the letter \u27e8j\u27e9 were subsequently developed.[5] Minims may also have finals of their own.\nThe script has many more scribal abbreviations than Carolingian, adding to the speed in which it could be written.\nSchwabacher[edit]\nMain article: Schwabacher\nSchwabacher was a blackletter form that was much used in early German print typefaces. It continued to be used occasionally until the 20th century. Characteristics of Schwabacher are:\nThe small letter \u27e8o\u27e9 is rounded on both sides, though at the top and at the bottom, the two strokes join in an angle. Other small letters have analogous forms.\nThe small letter \u27e8g\u27e9 has a horizontal stroke at its top that forms crosses with the two downward strokes.\nThe capital letter \u27e8H\u27e9 has a peculiar form somewhat reminiscent of the small letter \u27e8h\u27e9.\nFraktur[edit]\nMain article: Fraktur\nFraktur is a form of blackletter that became the most common German blackletter typeface by the mid-16th century. Its use was so common that often any blackletter form is called Fraktur in Germany. Characteristics of Fraktur are:\nThe left side of the small letter \u27e8o\u27e9 is formed by an angular stroke, the right side by a rounded stroke. At the top and at the bottom, both strokes join in an angle. Other small letters have analogous forms.\nThe capital letters are compound of rounded \u27e8c\u27e9-shaped or \u27e8s\u27e9-shaped strokes.\nHere is the entire alphabet in Fraktur (minus the long s and the sharp s \u27e8\u00df\u27e9), using the AMS Euler Fraktur typeface:\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nU\nV\nW\nX\nY\nZ\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {A}}{\\mathfrak {B}}{\\mathfrak {C}}{\\mathfrak {D}}{\\mathfrak {E}}{\\mathfrak {F}}{\\mathfrak {G}}{\\mathfrak {H}}{\\mathfrak {I}}{\\mathfrak {J}}{\\mathfrak {K}}{\\mathfrak {L}}{\\mathfrak {M}}{\\mathfrak {N}}{\\mathfrak {O}}{\\mathfrak {P}}{\\mathfrak {Q}}{\\mathfrak {R}}{\\mathfrak {S}}{\\mathfrak {T}}{\\mathfrak {U}}{\\mathfrak {V}}{\\mathfrak {W}}{\\mathfrak {X}}{\\mathfrak {Y}}{\\mathfrak {Z}}}\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\nk\nl\nm\nn\no\np\nq\nr\ns\nt\nu\nv\nw\nx\ny\nz\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {a}}{\\mathfrak {b}}{\\mathfrak {c}}{\\mathfrak {d}}{\\mathfrak {e}}{\\mathfrak {f}}{\\mathfrak {g}}{\\mathfrak {h}}{\\mathfrak {i}}{\\mathfrak {j}}{\\mathfrak {k}}{\\mathfrak {l}}{\\mathfrak {m}}{\\mathfrak {n}}{\\mathfrak {o}}{\\mathfrak {p}}{\\mathfrak {q}}{\\mathfrak {r}}{\\mathfrak {s}}{\\mathfrak {t}}{\\mathfrak {u}}{\\mathfrak {v}}{\\mathfrak {w}}{\\mathfrak {x}}{\\mathfrak {y}}{\\mathfrak {z}}}\nCursiva[edit]\nCursiva refers to a very large variety of forms of blackletter; as with modern cursive writing, there is no real standard form. It developed in the 14th century as a simplified form of textualis, with influence from the form of textualis as used for writing charters. Cursiva developed partly because of the introduction of paper, which was smoother than parchment. It was therefore, easier to write quickly on paper in a cursive script.\nIn cursiva, descenders are more frequent, especially in the letters \u27e8f\u27e9 and \u27e8s\u27e9, and ascenders are curved and looped rather than vertical (seen especially in the letter \u27e8d\u27e9). The letters \u27e8a\u27e9, \u27e8g\u27e9 and \u27e8s\u27e9 (at the end of a word) are very similar to their Carolingian forms. However, not all of these features are found in every example of cursiva, which makes it difficult to determine whether or not a script may be called cursiva at all.\nLieftinck also divided cursiva into three styles: littera cursiva formata was the most legible and calligraphic style. Littera cursiva textualis (or libraria) was the usual form, used for writing standard books, and it generally was written with a larger pen, leading to larger letters. Littera cursiva currens was used for textbooks and other unimportant books and it had very little standardization in forms.\nHybrida[edit]\nHybrida is also called bastarda (especially in France), and as its name suggests, is a hybrid form of the script. It is a mixture of textualis and cursiva, developed in the early 15th century. From textualis, it borrowed vertical ascenders, while from cursiva, it borrowed long \u27e8f\u27e9 and \u27e8\u017f\u27e9, single-looped \u27e8a\u27e9, and \u27e8g\u27e9 with an open descender (similar to Carolingian forms).\nDonatus-Kalender[edit]\nThe Donatus-Kalender (also known as Donatus-und-Kalender or D-K) is the name for the metal type design that Gutenberg used in his earliest surviving printed works, dating from the early 1450s. The name is taken from two works: the Ars grammatica of Aelius Donatus, a Latin grammar, and the Kalender (calendar).[6] It is a form of textura.\nBlackletter typesetting[edit]\nWhile an antiqua typeface is usually a compound of roman types and italic types since the 16th-century French typographers, the blackletter typefaces never developed a similar distinction. Instead, they use letterspacing (German Sperrung) for emphasis. When using that method, blackletter ligatures like \u27e8ch\u27e9, \u27e8ck\u27e9, \u27e8tz\u27e9 or \u27e8\u017ft\u27e9 remain together without additional letterspacing (\u27e8\u017ft\u27e9 is dissolved, though). The use of bold text for emphasis is also alien to blackletter typefaces.\nWords from other languages, especially from Romance languages including Latin, are usually typeset in antiqua instead of blackletter.[7] Like that, single antiqua words or phrases may occur within a blackletter text. This does not apply, however, to loanwords that have been incorporated into the language.\nNational forms[edit]\nEngland[edit]\nTextualis[edit]\nBlackletter in a Latin Bible of 1407 AD, on display in Malmesbury Abbey, Wiltshire, England\nEnglish blackletter developed from the form of Carolingian minuscule used there after the Norman Conquest, sometimes called \"Romanesque minuscule\". Textualis forms developed after 1190 and were used most often until approximately 1300, after which it became used mainly for de luxe manuscripts. English forms of blackletter have been studied extensively and may be divided into many categories. Textualis formata (\"Old English\" or \"blackletter\"), textualis prescissa (or textualis sine pedibus, as it generally lacks feet on its minims), textualis quadrata (or psalterialis) and semi-quadrata, and textualis rotunda are various forms of high-grade formata styles of blackletter.\nThe University of Oxford borrowed the littera parisiensis in the 13th century and early 14th century, and the littera oxoniensis form is almost indistinguishable from its Parisian counterpart; however, there are a few differences, such as the round final \u27e8s\u27e9 forms, resembling the number \u27e88\u27e9, rather than the long \u27e8s\u27e9 used in the final position in the Paris script.\nHandbill of 1715, with the main text in blackletter type, publishing a royal proclamation for the apprehension of the Jacobite leader Sir William Wyndham\nPrinters of the late 15th and early 16th centuries commonly used blackletter typefaces, but under the influence of Renaissance tastes, Roman typefaces grew in popularity, until by about 1590 most presses had converted to them.[8] However, blackletter was considered to be more readily legible (especially by the less literate classes of society), and it therefore remained in use throughout the 17th century and into the 18th for documents intended for widespread dissemination, such as proclamations and Acts of Parliament, and for literature aimed at the common people, such as ballads, chivalric romances, and jokebooks.[9][10]\nChaucer's works had been printed in blackletter in the late 15th century, but were subsequently more usually printed in Roman type. Horace Walpole wrote in 1781 that \"I am too, though a Goth, so modern a Goth that I hate the black letter, and I love Chaucer better in Dryden and Baskerville than in his own language and dress.\"[11]\nCursiva[edit]\nEnglish cursiva began to be used in the 13th century, and soon replaced littera oxoniensis as the standard university script. The earliest cursive blackletter form is Anglicana, a very round and looped script, which also had a squarer and angular counterpart, Anglicana formata. The formata form was used until the 15th century and also was used to write vernacular texts. An Anglicana bastarda form developed from a mixture of Anglicana and textualis, but by the 16th century, the principal cursive blackletter used in England was the Secretary script, which originated in Italy and came to England by way of France. Secretary script has a somewhat haphazard appearance, and its forms of the letters \u27e8a\u27e9, \u27e8g\u27e9, \u27e8r\u27e9 and \u27e8s\u27e9 are unique, unlike any forms in any other English script.\nFrance[edit]\nTextualis[edit]\nFrench textualis was tall and narrow compared to other national forms, and was most fully developed in the late 13th century in Paris. In the 13th century there also was an extremely small version of textualis used to write miniature Bibles, known as \"pearl script\". Another form of French textualis in this century was the script developed at the University of Paris, littera parisiensis, which also is small in size and designed to be written quickly, not calligraphically.\nCursiva[edit]\nFrench cursiva was used from the 13th to the 16th century, when it became highly looped, messy, and slanted. Bastarda, the \"hybrid\" mixture of cursiva and textualis, developed in the 15th century and was used for vernacular texts as well as Latin. A more angular form of bastarda was used in Burgundy, the lettre de forme or lettre bourgouignonne, for books of hours such as the Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures of John, Duke of Berry.\nGermany[edit]\nSchwabacher lettering. The text reads: \"Beispiel Alte Schwabacher: Victor jagt zw\u00f6lf Boxk\u00e4mpfer quer \u00fcber den Sylter Deich.\" Roughly translated to English, it reads \"Example of Old Schwabacher: Victor chases twelve boxers across the Sylt dike.\"\nDespite the frequent association of blackletter with German, the script was actually very slow to develop in German-speaking areas. It developed first in those areas closest to France and then spread to the east and south in the 13th century. The German-speaking areas are, however, where blackletter remained in use the longest.\nSchwabacher typefaces dominated in Germany from about 1480 to 1530, and the style continued in use occasionally until the 20th century. Most importantly, all of the works of Martin Luther, leading to the Protestant Reformation, as well as the Apocalypse of Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1498), used this typeface. Johann B\u00e4mler, a printer from Augsburg, probably first used it as early as 1472. The origins of the name remain unclear; some assume that a typeface-carver from the village of Schwabach\u2014one who worked externally and who thus became known as the Schwabacher\u2014designed the typeface.\nTextualis[edit]\nGerman Textualis is usually very heavy and angular, and there are few characteristic features that are common to all occurrences of the script. One common feature is the use of the letter \u27e8w\u27e9 for Latin \u27e8vu\u27e9 or \u27e8uu\u27e9. Textualis was first used in the 13th and 14th centuries, and subsequently become more elaborate and decorated, as well as being reserved used for liturgical works only.\nJohann Gutenberg used a textualis typeface for his famous Gutenberg Bible in 1455. Schwabacher, a blackletter with more rounded letters, soon became the usual printed typeface, but it was replaced by Fraktur in the early 17th century.\nFraktur lettering. The text reads: \"Walbaum-Fraktur: Victor jagt zw\u00f6lf Boxk\u00e4mpfer quer \u00fcber den Sylter Deich.\" Roughly translated to English, it reads \"Walbaum Fraktur: Victor chases twelve boxers across the Sylt dyke.\"\nFraktur came into use when Emperor Maximilian I (1493\u20131519) established a series of books and had a new typeface created specifically for this purpose. In the 19th century, the use of antiqua alongside Fraktur increased, leading to the Antiqua-Fraktur dispute, which lasted until the Nazis abandoned Fraktur in 1941. Since it was so common, all kinds of blackletter tend to be called Fraktur in German.\nCursiva[edit]\nMain article: Kurrent\nThe names of four common blackletter typefaces written in their respective styles German cursiva is similar to the cursive scripts in other areas, but forms of \u27e8a\u27e9, \u27e8s\u27e9 and other letters are more varied; here too, the letter \u27e8w\u27e9 is often used. A hybrida form, which was basically cursiva with fewer looped letters and with similar square proportions as textualis, was used in the 15th and 16th centuries.\nIn the 18th century, the pointed quill was adopted for blackletter handwriting. In the early 20th century, the S\u00fctterlin script was introduced in the schools.\nItaly[edit]\nRotunda[edit]\nMain article: Rotunda (script)\nItalian blackletter also is known as rotunda, as it was less angular than those produced by northern printing centers. The most common form of Italian rotunda was littera bononiensis, used at the University of Bologna in the 13th century. Biting is a common feature in rotunda, but breaking is not.\nItalian Rotunda also is characterized by unique abbreviations, such as \u27e8q\u27e9 with a line beneath the bow signifying qui, and unusual spellings, such as \u27e8x\u27e9 for \u27e8s\u27e9 (milex rather than miles).\nCursiva[edit]\nItalian cursive developed in the 13th century from scripts used by notaries. The more calligraphic form is known as minuscola cancelleresca italiana (or simply cancelleresca, chancery hand), which developed into a book hand, a script used for writing books rather than charters, in the 14th century. Cancelleresca influenced the development of bastarda in France and secretary hand in England.\nThe Netherlands[edit]\nTextualis mixed with select use of Antiqua in an 1853 Dutch edition of the New Testament\nTextualis[edit]\nA textualis form, commonly known as Gotisch or \"Gothic script\", was used for general publications from the fifteenth century on, but became restricted to official documents and religious publications during the seventeenth century. Its use persisted into the nineteenth century for editions of the State Translation of the Bible, but otherwise became obsolete.\nUnicode[edit]\nMathematical blackletter characters are separately encoded in Unicode in the Mathematical alphanumeric symbols range at U+1D504-1D537 and U+1D56C-1D59F (bold), except for individual letters already encoded in the Letterlike Symbols range (plus long s at U+017F).[12][13]\nThis block of characters should be used only for setting mathematical text, as mathematical texts use blackletter symbols contrastively to other letter styles.[14] For stylized blackletter prose, the normal Latin letters should be used, with font choice or other markup used to indicate blackletter styling. The character names use \"Fraktur\" for the mathematical alphanumeric symbols, while \"blackletter\" is used for those symbol characters in the letterlike symbols range.\nMathematical Fraktur:\n\ud835\udd04 \ud835\udd05 \u212d \ud835\udd07 \ud835\udd08 \ud835\udd09 \ud835\udd0a \u210c \u2111 \ud835\udd0d \ud835\udd0e \ud835\udd0f \ud835\udd10 \ud835\udd11 \ud835\udd12 \ud835\udd13 \ud835\udd14 \u211c \ud835\udd16 \ud835\udd17 \ud835\udd18 \ud835\udd19 \ud835\udd1a \ud835\udd1b \ud835\udd1c \u2128 \ud835\udd1e \ud835\udd1f \ud835\udd20 \ud835\udd21 \ud835\udd22 \ud835\udd23 \ud835\udd24 \ud835\udd25 \ud835\udd26 \ud835\udd27 \ud835\udd28 \ud835\udd29 \ud835\udd2a \ud835\udd2b \ud835\udd2c \ud835\udd2d \ud835\udd2e \ud835\udd2f \ud835\udd30 \ud835\udd31 \ud835\udd32 \ud835\udd33 \ud835\udd34 \ud835\udd35 \ud835\udd36 \ud835\udd37\nMathematical Bold Fraktur:\n\ud835\udd6c \ud835\udd6d \ud835\udd6e \ud835\udd6f \ud835\udd70 \ud835\udd71 \ud835\udd72 \ud835\udd73 \ud835\udd74 \ud835\udd75 \ud835\udd76 \ud835\udd77 \ud835\udd78 \ud835\udd79 \ud835\udd7a \ud835\udd7b \ud835\udd7c \ud835\udd7d \ud835\udd7e \ud835\udd7f \ud835\udd80 \ud835\udd81 \ud835\udd82 \ud835\udd83 \ud835\udd84 \ud835\udd85 \ud835\udd86 \ud835\udd87 \ud835\udd88 \ud835\udd89 \ud835\udd8a \ud835\udd8b \ud835\udd8c \ud835\udd8d \ud835\udd8e \ud835\udd8f \ud835\udd90 \ud835\udd91 \ud835\udd92 \ud835\udd93 \ud835\udd94 \ud835\udd95 \ud835\udd96 \ud835\udd97 \ud835\udd98 \ud835\udd99 \ud835\udd9a \ud835\udd9b \ud835\udd9c \ud835\udd9d \ud835\udd9e \ud835\udd9f\nNote: (The above may not render fully in all web browsers.)\nFonts supporting the range include Code2001, Cambria Math, and Quivira (textura style).\nFor normal text writing, the ordinary Latin code points are used.

The CD standard was proposed by Sony and Philips in 1980 and the technology was introduced to the U.S. market in 1983. CDs can hold up to 700 MB of data or 80 minutes of audio. The data on a CD is stored as small notches on the disc and is read by a laser from an optical drive. The drives translate the notches (which represent 1's and 0's) into usable data.\nThe first CDs were audio CDs, which eventually replaced audio tapes (which earlier replaced records). Audio CDs have the advantage of allowing the user to jump to different places on the disc. CDs can also be listened to an unlimited number of times without losing quality. Audio tapes can start to lose quality after listening to them as few as ten times. This is because the laser that reads the data on a CD doesn't put pressure on the disc, whereas the playheads on a tape deck slowly wear away the magnetic strip on the tape.\nIn 1985, CD-ROMs hit the computer market. Because they could store far more information than floppy discs (700 MB compared to 1.4 MB), CDs soon became the most common software format. In 1988, the CD-R (CD-Recordable) technology was introduced, allowing computer users to burn their own CDs. However, this technology did not become mainstream until the late 1990s. A smaller 3\" CD, called \"CD-3\" is also available and is readable by most tray-loading CD-ROM drives.\nUpdated 2006\nAPA\nMLA\nChicago\nHTML\nLink\nhttps://techterms.com/definition/cd\nCopy\n\u2039 \u00a0CCD\u00a0|\u00a0CD-R\u00a0 \u203a\nTech Factor\n?\n1 / 10\nRelated Terms\nCD-ROM\nCD-R\nCD-RW\nDVD\nBlu-ray\nOptical Media\nOptical Drive\nCD Images\nBottom of a CD\nDefinitions by TechTerms.com\nThe definition of CD on this page is an original TechTerms.com definition.

Its instant transaction finality makes Sui a prime candidate for on-chain use cases like DeFi and GameFi. The blockchain is programmed in Rust, a programming language with a focus on fast and secure transaction executions. Rust is also the programming language of Solana, another high-speed blockchain.\nSui\u2019s declared goal is to \u201ccater to the next billion users in web3\u201d by offering decentralized application (Dapp) deployment with a superior smart contract architecture compared to rival chains like Ethereum. The blockchain utilizes a process called \u201ctransaction parallelization\u201d to achieve that, which allows transaction processing in \u201cparallel agreement.\u201d This \u201chorizontal scaling,\u201d as Sui dubs it, leads to better data organization in the byzantine fault-tolerant proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism\n.\nFriends, we are glad to inform you about the beginning of our joint airdrop with the project \"SUI BLOCKCHAIN\". In honor of the soon token listing on our site we announce a three-day non-public AirDrop worth $500 in token \"SUI\".\nEveryone who found out about our AIRDROP will have the right to receive it, but TOP50 active users of \"TRUSTPAD\" and 50 random participants of \"SUI BLOCKCHAIN\" got the notification about it.

Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of searches, including image search, video search, academic search,[3] news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.\nAs an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer-programmed algorithms that dictate search engine behavior, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine when websites rank higher on the search engine results page (SERP). These visitors can then potentially be converted into customers.[4]\nContents\n1 History\n1.1 Relationship with Google\n2 Methods\n2.1 Getting indexed\n2.2 Preventing crawling\n2.3 Increasing prominence\n2.4 White hat versus black hat techniques\n3 As marketing strategy\n4 International markets\n5 Legal precedents\n6 See also\n7 References\n8 External links\nHistory\nWebmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Initially, all webmasters only needed to submit the address of a page, or URL, to the various engines, which would send a web crawler to crawl that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be indexed.[5] The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine's own server. A second program, known as an indexer, extracts information about the page, such as the words it contains, where they are located, and any weight for specific words, as well as all links the page contains. All of this information is then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date.\nWebsite owners recognized the value of a high ranking and visibility in search engine results,[6] creating an opportunity for both white hat and black hat SEO practitioners. According to industry analyst Danny Sullivan, the phrase \"search engine optimization\" probably came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.[7]\nEarly versions of search algorithms relied on webmaster-provided information such as the keyword meta tag or index files in engines like ALIWEB. Meta tags provide a guide to each page's content. Using metadata to index pages was found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster's choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site's actual content. Flawed data in meta tags, such as those that were not accurate, complete, or falsely attributes, created the potential for pages to be mischaracterized in irrelevant searches.[8][dubious\n\u2013 discuss] Web content providers also manipulated some attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines.[9] By 1997, search engine designers recognized that webmasters were making efforts to rank well in their search engine and that some webmasters were even manipulating their rankings in search results by stuffing pages with excessive or irrelevant keywords. Early search engines, such as Altavista and Infoseek, adjusted their algorithms to prevent webmasters from manipulating rankings.[10]\nBy heavily relying on factors such as keyword density, which were exclusively within a webmaster's control, early search engines suffered from abuse and ranking manipulation. To provide better results to their users, search engines had to adapt to ensure their results pages showed the most relevant search results, rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters. This meant moving away from heavy reliance on term density to a more holistic process for scoring semantic signals.[11] Since the success and popularity of a search engine are determined by its ability to produce the most relevant results to any given search, poor quality or irrelevant search results could lead users to find other search sources. Search engines responded by developing more complex ranking algorithms, taking into account additional factors that were more difficult for webmasters to manipulate.\nCompanies that employ overly aggressive techniques can get their client websites banned from the search results. In 2005, the Wall Street Journal reported on a company, Traffic Power, which allegedly used high-risk techniques and failed to disclose those risks to its clients.[12] Wired magazine reported that the same company sued blogger and SEO Aaron Wall for writing about the ban.[13] Google's Matt Cutts later confirmed that Google did in fact ban Traffic Power and some of its clients.[14]\nSome search engines have also reached out to the SEO industry and are frequent sponsors and guests at SEO conferences, webchats, and seminars. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with website optimization.[15][16] Google has a Sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website.[17] Bing Webmaster Tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds, allows users to determine the \"crawl rate,\" and track the web pages index status.\nIn 2015, it was reported that Google was developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products. In response, many brands began to take a different approach to their Internet marketing strategies.[18]\nRelationship with Google\nIn 1998, two graduate students at Stanford University, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, developed \"Backrub,\" a search engine that relied on a mathematical algorithm to rate the prominence of web pages. The number calculated by the algorithm, PageRank, is a function of the quantity and strength of inbound links.[19] PageRank estimates the likelihood that a given page will be reached by a web user who randomly surfs the web and follows links from one page to another. In effect, this means that some links are stronger than others, as a higher PageRank page is more likely to be reached by the random web surfer.\nPage and Brin founded Google in 1998.[20] Google attracted a loyal following among the growing number of Internet users, who liked its simple design.[21] Off-page factors (such as PageRank and hyperlink analysis) were considered as well as on-page factors (such as keyword frequency, meta tags, headings, links and site structure) to enable Google to avoid the kind of manipulation seen in search engines that only considered on-page factors for their rankings. Although PageRank was more difficult to game, webmasters had already developed link-building tools and schemes to influence the Inktomi search engine, and these methods proved similarly applicable to gaming PageRank. Many sites focus on exchanging, buying, and selling links, often on a massive scale. Some of these schemes, or link farms, involved the creation of thousands of sites for the sole purpose of link spamming.[22]\nBy 2004, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation. In June 2007, The New York Times' Saul Hansell stated Google ranks sites using more than 200 different signals.[23] The leading search engines, Google, Bing, and Yahoo, do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. Some SEO practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization and have shared their personal opinions.[24] Patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand search engines.[25] In 2005, Google began personalizing search results for each user. Depending on their history of previous searches, Google crafted results for logged in users.[26]\nIn 2007, Google announced a campaign against paid links that transfer PageRank.[27] On June 15, 2009, Google disclosed that they had taken measures to mitigate the effects of PageRank sculpting by use of the nofollow attribute on links. Matt Cutts, a well-known software engineer at Google, announced that Google Bot would no longer treat any no follow links, in the same way, to prevent SEO service providers from using nofollow for PageRank sculpting.[28] As a result of this change, the usage of nofollow led to evaporation of PageRank. In order to avoid the above, SEO engineers developed alternative techniques that replace nofollowed tags with obfuscated JavaScript and thus permit PageRank sculpting. Additionally, several solutions have been suggested that include the usage of iframes, Flash, and JavaScript.[29]\nIn December 2009, Google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results.[30] On June 8, 2010 a new web indexing system called Google Caffeine was announced. Designed to allow users to find news results, forum posts, and other content much sooner after publishing than before, Google Caffeine was a change to the way Google updated its index in order to make things show up quicker on Google than before. According to Carrie Grimes, the software engineer who announced Caffeine for Google, \"Caffeine provides 50 percent fresher results for web searches than our last index...\"[31] Google Instant, real-time-search, was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant. Historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings. With the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs, the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results.[32]\nIn February 2011, Google announced the Panda update, which penalizes websites containing content duplicated from other websites and sources. Historically websites have copied content from one another and benefited in search engine rankings by engaging in this practice. However, Google implemented a new system that punishes sites whose content is not unique.[33] The 2012 Google Penguin attempted to penalize websites that used manipulative techniques to improve their rankings on the search engine.[34] Although Google Penguin has been presented as an algorithm aimed at fighting web spam, it really focuses on spammy links[35] by gauging the quality of the sites the links are coming from. The 2013 Google Hummingbird update featured an algorithm change designed to improve Google's natural language processing and semantic understanding of web pages. Hummingbird's language processing system falls under the newly recognized term of \"conversational search,\" where the system pays more attention to each word in the query in order to better match the pages to the meaning of the query rather than a few words.[36] With regards to the changes made to search engine optimization, for content publishers and writers, Hummingbird is intended to resolve issues by getting rid of irrelevant content and spam, allowing Google to produce high-quality content and rely on them to be 'trusted' authors.\nIn October 2019, Google announced they would start applying BERT models for English language search queries in the US. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was another attempt by Google to improve their natural language processing, but this time in order to better understand the search queries of their users.[37] In terms of search engine optimization, BERT intended to connect users more easily to relevant content and increase the quality of traffic coming to websites that are ranking in the Search Engine Results Page.\nMethods\nGetting indexed\nA simple illustration of the Pagerank algorithm. Percentage shows the perceived importance.\nThe leading search engines, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, use crawlers to find pages for their algorithmic search results. Pages that are linked from other search engine-indexed pages do not need to be submitted because they are found automatically. The Yahoo! Directory and DMOZ, two major directories which closed in 2014 and 2017 respectively, both required manual submission and human editorial review.[38] Google offers Google Search Console, for which an XML Sitemap feed can be created and submitted for free to ensure that all pages are found, especially pages that are not discoverable by automatically following links[39] in addition to their URL submission console.[40] Yahoo! formerly operated a paid submission service that guaranteed to crawl for a cost per click;[41] however, this practice was discontinued in 2009.\nSearch engine crawlers may look at a number of different factors when crawling a site. Not every page is indexed by search engines. The distance of pages from the root directory of a site may also be a factor in whether or not pages get crawled.[42]\nToday, most people are searching on Google using a mobile device.[43] In November 2016, Google announced a major change to the way crawling websites and started to make their index mobile-first, which means the mobile version of a given website becomes the starting point for what Google includes in their index.[44] In May 2019, Google updated the rendering engine of their crawler to be the latest version of Chromium (74 at the time of the announcement).\nGoogle indicated that they would regularly update the Chromium rendering engine to the latest version.[45]\nIn December 2019, Google began updating the User-Agent string of their crawler to reflect the latest Chrome version used by their rendering service.\nThe delay was to allow webmasters time to update their code that responded to particular bot User-Agent strings.\nGoogle ran evaluations and felt confident the impact would be minor.[46]\nPreventing crawling\nMain article: Robots exclusion standard\nTo avoid undesirable content in the search indexes, webmasters can instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard robots.txt file in the root directory of the domain. Additionally, a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine's database by using a meta tag specific to robots (usually <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\"> ). When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located in the root directory is the first file crawled. The robots.txt file is then parsed and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. As a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file, it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish to crawl. Pages typically prevented from being crawled include login-specific pages such as shopping carts and user-specific content such as search results from internal searches. In March 2007, Google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam.[47] In 2020, Google sunsetted the standard (and open-sourced their code) and now treats it as a hint not a directive. To adequately ensure that pages are not indexed, a page-level robot's meta tag should be included.[48]\nIncreasing prominence\nA variety of methods can increase the prominence of a webpage within the search results. Cross linking between pages of the same website to provide more links to important pages may improve its visibility. Page design makes users trust a site and want to stay once they find it. When people bounce off a site, it counts against the site and affects its credibility. \u00a0[49] Writing content that includes frequently searched keyword phrases so as to be relevant to a wide variety of search queries will tend to increase traffic. Updating content so as to keep search engines crawling back frequently can give additional weight to a site. Adding relevant keywords to a web page's metadata, including the title tag and meta description, will tend to improve the relevancy of a site's search listings, thus increasing traffic. URL canonicalization of web pages accessible via multiple URLs, using the canonical link element[50] or via 301 redirects can help make sure links to different versions of the URL all count towards the page's link popularity score. These are known as incoming links, which point to the URL and can count towards the page link's popularity score, impacting the credibility of a website. [49]\nAlso, in recent times Google is giving more priority to the below elements for SERP (Search Engine Ranking Position).\nHTTPS version (Secure Site)\nPage Speed\nStructured Data\nMobile Compatibility\nAMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)\nBERT\nWhite hat versus black hat techniques\nSEO techniques can be classified into two broad categories: techniques that search engine companies recommend as part of good design (\"white hat\"), and those techniques of which search engines do not approve (\"black hat\"). Search engines attempt to minimize the effect of the latter, among them spamdexing. Industry commentators have classified these methods and the practitioners who employ them as either white hat SEO or black hat SEO.[51] White hats tend to produce results that last a long time, whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing.[52]\nAn SEO technique is considered a white hat if it conforms to the search engines' guidelines and involves no deception. As the search engine guidelines[15][16][53] are not written as a series of rules or commandments, this is an important distinction to note. White hat SEO is not just about following guidelines but is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see. White hat advice is generally summed up as creating content for users, not for search engines, and then making that content easily accessible to the online \"spider\" algorithms, rather than attempting to trick the algorithm from its intended purpose. White hat SEO is in many ways similar to web development that promotes accessibility,[54] although the two are not identical.\nBlack hat SEO attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines or involve deception. One black hat technique uses hidden text, either as text colored similar to the background, in an invisible div, or positioned off-screen. Another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine, a technique known as cloaking. Another category sometimes used is grey hat SEO. This is in between the black hat and white hat approaches, where the methods employed avoid the site being penalized but do not act in producing the best content for users. Grey hat SEO is entirely focused on improving search engine rankings.\nSearch engines may penalize sites they discover using black or grey hat methods, either by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases altogether. Such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search engines' algorithms or by a manual site review. One example was the February 2006 Google removal of both BMW Germany and Ricoh Germany for the use of deceptive practices.[55] Both companies, however, quickly apologized, fixed the offending pages, and were restored to Google's search engine results page.[56]\nAs marketing strategy\nSEO is not an appropriate strategy for every website, and other Internet marketing strategies can be more effective, such as paid advertising through pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns, depending on the site operator's goals. Search engine marketing (SEM) is the practice of designing, running, and optimizing search engine ad campaigns. Its difference from SEO is most simply depicted as the difference between paid and unpaid priority ranking in search results. SEM focuses on prominence more so than relevance; website developers should regard SEM with the utmost importance with consideration to visibility as most navigate to the primary listings of their search.[57] A successful Internet marketing campaign may also depend upon building high-quality web pages to engage and persuade internet users, setting up analytics programs to enable site owners to measure results, and improving a site's conversion rate.[58][59] In November 2015, Google released a full 160-page version of its Search Quality Rating Guidelines to the public,[60] which revealed a shift in their focus towards \"usefulness\" and mobile local search. In recent years the mobile market has exploded, overtaking the use of desktops, as shown in by StatCounter in October 2016, where they analyzed 2.5 million websites and found that 51.3% of the pages were loaded by a mobile device.[61] Google has been one of the companies that are utilizing the popularity of mobile usage by encouraging websites to use their Google Search Console, the Mobile-Friendly Test, which allows companies to measure up their website to the search engine results and determine how user-friendly their websites are. The closer the keywords are together their ranking will improve based on key terms. [49]\nSEO may generate an adequate return on investment. However, search engines are not paid for organic search traffic, their algorithms change, and there are no guarantees of continued referrals. Due to this lack of guarantee and uncertainty, a business that relies heavily on search engine traffic can suffer major losses if the search engines stop sending visitors.[62] Search engines can change their algorithms, impacting a website's search engine ranking, possibly resulting in a serious loss of traffic. According to Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt, in 2010, Google made over 500 algorithm changes \u2013 almost 1.5 per day.[63] It is considered a wise business practice for website operators to liberate themselves from dependence on search engine traffic.[64] In addition to accessibility in terms of web crawlers (addressed above), user web accessibility has become increasingly important for SEO.\nInternational markets\nOptimization techniques are highly tuned to the dominant search engines in the target market.\nThe search engines' market shares vary from market to market, as does competition.\nIn 2003, Danny Sullivan stated that Google represented about 75% of all searches.[65] In markets outside the United States, Google's share is often larger, and Google remains the dominant search engine worldwide as of 2007.[66] As of 2006, Google had an 85\u201390% market share in Germany.[67] While there were hundreds of SEO firms in the US at that time, there were only about five in Germany.[67] As of June 2008, the market share of Google in the UK was close to 90% according to Hitwise.[68] That market share is achieved in a number of countries.\nAs of 2009, there are only a few large markets where Google is not the leading search engine. In most cases, when Google is not leading in a given market, it is lagging behind a local player. The most notable example markets are China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and the Czech Republic, where respectively Baidu, Yahoo! Japan, Naver, Yandex and Seznam are market leaders.\nSuccessful search optimization for international markets may require professional translation of web pages, registration of a domain name with a top level domain in the target market, and web hosting that provides a local IP address. Otherwise, the fundamental elements of search optimization are essentially the same, regardless of language.[67]\nLegal precedents\nOn October 17, 2002, SearchKing filed suit in the United States District Court, Western District of Oklahoma, against the search engine Google. SearchKing's claim was that Google's tactics to prevent spamdexing constituted a tortious interference with contractual relations.\nOn May 27, 2003, the court granted Google's motion to dismiss the complaint because SearchKing \"failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\"[69][70]\nIn March 2006, KinderStart filed a lawsuit against Google over search engine rankings. KinderStart's website was removed from Google's index prior to the lawsuit, and the amount of traffic to the site dropped by 70%. On March 16, 2007, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (San Jose Division) dismissed KinderStart's complaint without leave to amend and partially granted Google's motion for Rule 11 sanctions against KinderStart's attorney, requiring him to pay part of Google's legal expenses.[71][72]\nSee also\nBlog network\nCompetitor backlinking\nList of search engines\nSearch engine marketing\nSearch neutrality, the opposite of search manipulation\nUser intent\nWebsite promotion\nReferences\n^ \"SEO - search engine optimization\".

Did we miss something? DM us on Twitter to ask anything else.\nIs registering for a PREMINT list safe?\nYes. Over 1 million list registrations have happened on PREMINT without issue. When you sign in with PREMINT, you only are validating ownership of the wallet address. PREMINT does not get any permissions to perform transactions, and does not have any way of withdrawing anything from your wallet.\nWho else has used PREMINT?\nPremint has been used by some of the top artists and collections in the NFT ecosystem, including XCOPY, Coldie, DeekayMotion, Cool Cats, Known Origin, Async Art, Shaq, and over 1,000 more.\nWhy does PREMINT ask permission to \u201csuggest transactions to approve\u201d when logging in with MetaMask?\nMetaMask\u2019s standard text for anyone connecting their wallet (as of 3/2022) is \u201cSee address, account balance, activity, and suggest transactions to approve.\u201d We don\u2019t have any control over that and you\u2019ll see that message when signing into any site with MetaMask.\nWhy do I need to \u201cSign\u201d a message in addition to connecting my wallet.\nSigning is the only way we can truly know that you are the owner of the wallet you are connecting. Signing is a safe, gas-less transaction that does not in any way give PREMINT permission to perform any transactions with your wallet.\nIf I disconnect my wallet or social networks after registering, will my entry still be valid?\nPREMINT saves your wallet and social info as a part of the registration step, so you can disconnect everything afterwards and your entry is still valid.\nIf I transfer the required NFT after registering, will my registration still be valid?\nAs far as PREMINT is concerned, yes, but the project owner might check that you still own the token before finalizing the list.\nDo you record my IP address?\nWhen you register, we store an encrypted version of your IP address and save it with your registration, but we never save or share your actual IP address and there is no way to get it from what we save.\nI registered, but the project says my wallet isn\u2019t on the list. What happened?\nIf you fully registered, the only way your wallet wouldn\u2019t be on the list of registered wallets is if the project removed it. PREMINT never deletes wallets from the list for any reason.\nIt says my Discord or Twitter are attached to a different wallet. How do I disconnect them?\nIf you don\u2019t know what wallet your Discord or Twitter are connected to, just go to https://sushifrens-allowlist.com and you can force-disconnect them.\nWhat is an \u201caccess list\u201d? Isn\u2019t it called a \u201cwhitelist\u201d?\nWhile creators are welcome to name their PREMINT projects whatever they like, we choose to use the term \"allow list\" or \"access list\" vs \"whitelist\". \"Whitelist\" could be considered exclusionary language, and the spirit of web3 is about inclusion.\nPowered by PREMINT"

        "legitimate": "Introduction to Cladistics\nIntroductionto Cladistics Methodologyof Cladistics Implicationsof Cladistics The Needfor Cladistics\nAn Introduction to Cladistics\nThis module provides a brief introduction to the philosophy, methodology,\nand implications of cladistic analysis.\nMany of the terms that you will see\nalong the way are high-lighted, e.g., evolution,\nwhich means that they are included in the UCMP Glossary of\nPhylogenetic Terms. Each of these terms can be clicked on for a brief definition. After you've read through the pages on the implications and methodologies,\nyou will be armed in the ways of cladistics. Therefore, if you dare, you can\ntake a journey into the real world of cladistics. Should you choose to venture\non this journey, pray you are well-armed with good luck and wits! Synapomorphies are the basis for cladistics Cladistics is a particular method of hypothesizing relationships among\norganisms. Like other methods, it has its own set of assumptions,\nprocedures, and limitations. Cladistics is now accepted as the best method\navailable for phylogenetic analysis, for it provides an explicit and testable\nhypothesis of organismal relationships. The basic idea behind cladistics is that members of a group share a common\nevolutionary history, and are \"closely related,\" more so to members of the\nsame group than to other organisms. These groups are recognized by\nsharing unique features which were not present in distant ancestors. These\nshared derived characteristics are called synapomorphies. Note that it is not enough for organisms to share characteristics, in fact two\norganisms may share a great many characteristics and not be considered\nmembers of the same group. For example, consider a jellyfish, starfish, and a\nhuman; which two are most closely related? The jellyfish and starfish both\nlive in the water, have radial symmetry, and are invertebrates, so you might\nsuppose that they belong together in a group. This would not reflect\nevolutionary relationships, however, since the starfish and human are\nactually more closely related. It is not just the presence of shared\ncharacteristics which is important, but the presence of shared derived\ncharacteristics. In the example above, all three characteristics are believed\nto have been present in the common ancestor of all animals, and so are\ntrivial for determining relationships, since all three organisms in question\nbelong to the group \"animals.\" While humans are different from the other\ntwo organisms, they differ only in characteristics which arose newly in an\nancestor which is not shared with the other two. As you shall see on the\nnext page, chosing the right characters is one of the most important steps in\na cladistic analysis. What assumptions do cladists make? There are three basic assumptions in cladistics:\nAny group of organisms are related by descent from a common ancestor. There is a bifurcating pattern of cladogenesis. Change in characteristics occurs in lineages over time.\nThe first assumption is a general assumption made for all evolutionary\nbiology. It essentially means that life arose on earth only once, and\ntherefore all organisms are related in some way or other. Because of this, we\ncan take any collection of organisms and determine a meaningful pattern of\nrelationships, provided we have the right kind of information. Again, the\nassumption states that all the diversity of life on earth has been produced\nthrough the reproduction of existing organisms. The second assumption is perhaps the most controversial; that is, that new\nkinds of organisms may arise when existing species or populations divide\ninto exactly two groups. There are many biologists who hold that multiple new\nlineages\ncan arise from a single originating population at the same time,\nor near enough in time to be indistinguishable from such an event. While\nthis model could conceivably occur, it is not currently known how often this\nhas actually happened. The other objection raised against this assumption is\nthe possibility of interbreeding between distinct groups. This, however, is a\ngeneral problem of reconstructing evolutionary history, and although it\ncannot currently be handled well by cladistic methods, no other system has yet\nbeen devised which accounts for it. The final assumption, that characteristics of organisms change over time, is\nthe most important assumption in cladistics. It is only when characteristics\nchange that we are able to recognize different lineages or groups. The\nconvention is to call the \"original\" state of the characteristic\nplesiomorphic and the \"changed\" state apomorphic. The terms\n\"primitive\" and \"derived\" have also been used for these states, but they are\noften avoided by cladists, since those terms have been much abused in the past.

In the below image, AB is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment PQ and F is the midpoint of the line segment PQ.\nPerpendicular Bisector of a Line Segment\nPerpendicular Bisector Equation\nLets find it with points P(5,7), Q(6,6). Consider the co-ordinates of the points P and Q to be x1,y1 and x2,y2 respectively. We need to calculate the midpoints of the line PQ, which is F, and the slope to find the equation of the perpendicular bisector.\nStep 1\nLets calculate the midpoint of the line which is the average of the x and y co-ordinates.\nMidpoint of a line = x1+x2/2, y1+y2/2\nMidpoint of\nPQ\n=\n5+6/2, 7+6/2 = (11/2, 13/2)\nStep 2\nNext, we need to find the slope of the line PQ using the formula y2-y1/x2-x1. Kindly note that the slope is represented by the letter 'm'.\nSlope of PQ (m) = 6-7/6-5 = -1.\nStep 3\nNow, lets calculate the slope of the perpendicular bisector (AB) of the line PQ.\nThe slope of the perpendicular bisector = -1/slope of the line.\nTherefore for AB= -1/-1 = 1\nStep 4\nOnce we find the slope as above, we can find the equation with the slope and the midpoints.\nLets find the equation of the AB with midpoints (11/2,13/2) and the slope 1.\nFormula to find the equation\ny-y1 = m(x-x1)\ny-13/2 = 1(x-11/2)\nBy solving the above, we get the equation -x + y = 1. This is the perpendicular bisector equation (AB) of the line PQ.\nThis tutorial helps to learn the definition and the calculation of perpendicular bisector of a line segment with example.\nRelated Calculator\n>> Perpendicular Bisector Equation Calculator\nRelated Tutorials:\nLearn How To Calculate Distance Between Two Points\nLearn How To Calculate Coordinates Of Point Externally/Internally\nLearn How To Calculate Mid Point/Coordinates Of Point\nCentroid Of A Triangle Tutorial\nLearn How To Calculate Mid Point For 3 Dimension\nLearn How To Calculate Circumcenter Of Triangle\nCalculators and Converters\n\u21b3\nTutorials\n\u21b3\nAnalytical\nAsk a Question\nTop Calculators\nAge Calculator\nSD Calculator\nLogarithm\nLOVE Game\nPopular Calculators\nDerivative Calculator\nInverse of Matrix Calculator\nCompound Interest Calculator\nPregnancy Calculator Online\nTop Categories\nAlgebraAnalyticalDate DayFinanceHealthMortgageNumbersPhysicsStatistics More\nSitemap"

Including six casinos, the resort covers an area of 9,000,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (840,000\u00a0m2). The casinos have more than 250 gaming tables for blackjack, craps, roulette, and poker, and have more than 5,500 slot machines.[1][2] The casinos also have several restaurants, among them a Hard Rock Cafe. It has been developed since changes in state and federal laws in the late 20th century enabled Native American gaming on the sovereign reservations of federally recognized tribes.\nFoxwoods has two hotel towers, with a total of 2,228 hotel rooms; and an arcade for children and teens.\nThe original tower, the Grand Pequot Tower, opened in 1997, while the second opened in 2008 as the MGM Grand. It was re-branded the Fox Tower in 2013.[3] In 2015, a retail complex, known as Tanger Outlet Mall, opened between the two hotel towers with 85 stores featuring luxury goods.[4]\nContents\n1 History\n1.1 Debt default\n2 Design\n3 Gaming\n3.1 Poker (formerly WPT World Poker Room)\n3.2 Sporting events / entertainment\n4 Fox Tower\n4.1 Attractions\n5 Restaurants\n6 Unionization of employees\n7 See also\n8 Notelist\n9 References\n10 External links\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: Connecticut Indian Land Claims Settlement\nThe Mashantucket Pequot Tribe gained federal recognition and legal control of their reservation by an act of Congress in 1983, which overrode a veto by President Ronald Reagan.[5] The tribe moved forward with development. They founded Foxwoods in 1986 as a high-stakes bingo hall on their reservation.\nThe tribe partnered with Lim Goh Tong, a Chinese Malaysian who founded the only legal casino in Malaysia, for financing to expand Foxwoods into a full gaming casino.[6][7]\nIn 1992, the tribe added table games, followed by additional slot machines in 1993. G. Michael Brown became the chairman of the casino in 1993. In an agreement negotiated with the state of Connecticut, to gain their approval of the casino, the tribe agreed to pay 25\u00a0percent of the slot revenue to the state, a sum that amounted to almost $200 million per year as of 2007[update].[8]\nIn the fiscal year ending June 2008, Foxwoods' 6,300 slots handled more than $9.1 billion. In January 2012, the \"hold\" was $45 million.[9] A poker room and a high-limit 30-table game area were added in 1995.\nBecause Foxwoods is located on sovereign Mashantucket Pequot land, it is not required to comply with state laws related to smoking. Constructed in 1996, the casino is not a smoke-free facility. Due to complaints in the early 21st century from patrons and employees, it has designated many common areas, such as hallways, walkways, hotel lobbies, retail stores, and most restaurants, as non-smoking areas. In addition, it has designated certain areas for smokers. The poker room is non-smoking, and separate table gaming and slot areas are designated as non-smoking.\nIn 1997, the associated deluxe Grand Pequot Tower was opened for business.\nFoxwoods was once reported to be the world's largest casino,[10] though it was later surpassed by the Venetian Macau.[11]\nDebt default[edit]\nFor years after opening in 1992, Foxwoods had a monopoly on casino gambling in the region.[12] It made billions of dollars in profits.[citation needed] Shortly before the market recession of 2008, Foxwoods borrowed heavily to finance a massive expansion to include new hotel and conference facilities.[13] Starting in 2009, Foxwoods defaulted on debts totaling over two billion dollars.[14] As a result, in 2014 Standard & Poor's lowered Foxwoods' credit rating.[15] The Mashantucket Pequot, owners of Foxwoods, have applied for and received millions of dollars in federal grants.[16]\nDesign[edit]\nOver time, the casino management achieved full build-out of the resort by hiring several design and construction entities. The majority of the work from 1992 to 2001 was completed by Construction Managers CR Klewin aka Klewin Building Co. and the Architect of Record was JCJ Architecture (formerly Jeter, Cook & Jepson) of Hartford, Connecticut. Planning and concept designs were by New England Design Inc. and Nick606 Inc. Later phases were completed by Shawmut Design & Construction, Perini Building Co., AZ Corporation, and others, with design work by Steelman Partners, HKS, Inc., and others.\nThe resort managers revamped the whole resort and casino, re-branding it as \"The Fox\".[17] Additionally, the resort's appearance inspires frequent comparisons or references to it as \"Emerald City\", from the film Wizard of Oz.[18][19][20]\nGaming[edit]\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.

They may also be made on a total of more than 60 tracks (combined) for dog racing and horse racing. Races are projected on 50-foot (15\u00a0m) high digital screens.\nPoker (formerly WPT World Poker Room)[edit]\nThe Poker Room (formerly known as the WPT-World Poker Tour World Poker Room until 2012)[A] is located one floor below the Rainmaker Casino. Poker games of varying stakes are conducted here, including limit and no-limit Texas hold 'em, limit and pot-limit Omaha hold 'em (including hi/lo), and seven-card stud (high only and hi/lo).\nThe poker room was relocated and expanded in March 2006, increasing the number of tables from 76 to 114, making it the largest poker room outside California. It is the third-largest poker room in the world, after the Commerce Casino and the Bicycle Casino.[25][26]\nSporting events / entertainment[edit]\nSince 2014, three major mixed martial arts events have been held at Foxwoods: UFC Fight Night: Jacar\u00e9 vs. Mousasi, World Series of Fighting 20: Branch vs. McElligott and, most recently World Series of Fighting 24: Fitch vs. Okami.\nFox Tower[edit]\nFoxwoods Resort, 2009\nConstruction started in November 2005 on a $700 million expansion at Foxwoods. On April 25, 2006, Foxwoods announced that they would lease the MGM Grand brand name for the new building, and that MGM Mirage would be a partner in the expansion project. The expansion, entitled MGM Grand at Foxwoods, opened on May 17, 2008. It is a separate building from the main Foxwoods resort. A moving walkway and Tanger Outlets Foxwoods (built in 2015), now connect the two complexes. Amenities at the MGM Grand at Foxwoods included:[27]\n53 table games\n1,400 slot machines\n825 hotel rooms/suites\n4,000 seat performing arts theater\nFour restaurants and four retail outlets\nIn late 2013, MGM Mirage split from Foxwoods. The tribe renamed the building as The Fox Tower, part of a re-branding effort as they face new competition from other casinos in the region.[4]\nIn 2015, Tanger Outlets Foxwoods opened within the complex, located between the two hotel towers. Constructed for $120 million, the 85-store mall features luxury brands.[4]\nAttractions[edit]\nRide name\nManufacturer\nModel\nAmusement rides\nHighFlyer Zipline\nSoaring Eagle Rides[28]\nSoaring Eagle Zipline Ride\nMonza World-Class Karting\nOn Track Karting/PGK Designs\nGo-Karts\nXD Dark Ride[29]\nDark ride\nRestaurants[edit]\nCalifornia Pizza Kitchen\nDavid Burke Prime Steakhouse\nGuy Fieri's Foxwoods Kitchen + Bar\nHard Rock Cafe\nHigh Rollers Luxury Lanes & Sports Lounge\nCedars Steakhouse & Oyster Bar\nJohnny Rockets\nStony Creek Brewery\nSugar Factory American Brasserie\nWingstop\nVue 24\ncoming in the future Wahlburgers\nRegina Pizzeria\nCake by Franck\nNoodles\nUnionization of employees[edit]\nBeginning with an employee-led website to gain support and share ideas of how to react to changes employees had been going through, a small base of employees approached several union organizations to explore unionizing of dealers at Foxwoods Resort Casino. After the dealer group decided on the United Auto Workers in June 2007, the UAW helped start collecting signatures from dealers in support of a union. The UAW announced in September 2007 that it had collected the requisite number of signatures needed to hold an election to determine whether table games and poker dealers desired union representation or not.\nThe Tribe challenged the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board for their on-reservation Native American enterprises. Following hearings and review of the petitions, the NLRB ruled in favor of the union and ordered a union election to be conducted. On November 24, 2007, employees voted to unionize: 60\u00a0percent were in favor and 40\u00a0percent were against.[30] The Foxwoods dealers cast 1,289 ballots for the union, 852 against representation, with challenges to 36 additional ballots. Approximately 2,700 dealers and dual-rate dealers were eligible to vote in the election.\nAfter the workers won the right to unionize, Foxwoods Casino appealed the election results, reasserting its jurisdictional challenge. In addition, it said that the NLRB had made mistakes in conducting the vote. It had printed the ballot only in English and provided notices explaining the election in only one form of the Chinese language, thereby disenfranchising workers who spoke other languages. Furthermore, it said that interactions between union officials and some voters were unlawful.[31] An NLRB Administrative Law Judge ruled that the union and the board provided ample explanation of the election in a variety of languages. Foxwoods appealed the decision.\nThe Foxwoods dealers' union asked the state of Connecticut to improve the conditions of their workplace. Workers and union organizers pushed for legislation to ban smoking on the casino floors of Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun. The Mashantucket tribe opposed a complete ban on smoking; however, in May 2009 Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell signed an agreement with Foxwoods by which they would limit smoking areas in the casino.[32]\nOn January 26, 2010, dealers at Foxwoods reached a labor contract with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe. They are the largest group of union-represented dealers at any U.S. casino.[33] On August 7, 2013, the union announced a tentative new contract that would give dealers retroactive and future raises, set stricter limits on second-hand smoke, and give dealers the right to decide how tips are distributed.[34]\nIn April 2018, an additional 300 cleaning and maintenance workers voted to join the UAW.[35]\nSee also[edit]\nConnecticut portal\nGambling in Connecticut\nNative American gaming\nList of casinos in the United States\nMohegan Sun\u2014Connecticut's other casino\nMashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center\nNotelist[edit]\n^ As of 2012 Foxwoods no longer has any affiliation with the World Poker Tour.[24]\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Foxwoods Resort Casino Gaming\".

This gives you access to your data when and where you want,\" informs Google. \"When you download your past searches, a copy of your history will be saved securely to the Takeout folder in Google Drive. You can download the files to your computer if you want a copy on your computer.\"\nGoogle will send you an email when your archive is ready to download.\nThe download dialog is pretty unusual. It includes a warning message: \"Please read this carefully, it's not the usual yada yada.\" It suggests users to enable 2-step verification and it informs them that the archive includes sensitive data. \"If you have decided to take your data elsewhere, please research the data export policies of your destination.

Unveiled in 1997 by SanDisk and Siemens,[1] MMC is based on a surface-contact low pin-count serial interface using a single memory stack substrate assembly, and is therefore much smaller than earlier systems based on high pin-count parallel interfaces using traditional surface-mount assembly such as CompactFlash. Both products were initially introduced using SanDisk NOR-based flash technology. MMC is about the size of a postage stamp: 32\u00a0mm \u00d7 24\u00a0mm \u00d7 1.4\u00a0mm.\nMMC originally used a 1-bit serial interface, but newer versions[when?] of the specification allow transfers of 4 or 8 bits at a time. MMC can be used in many devices that can use Secure Digital (SD) cards.\nTypically, an MMC operates as a storage medium for devices, in a form that can easily be removed for access by a PC via a connected MMC reader. Modern computers, both laptops and desktops, often have SD slots, which can additionally read MMCs if the operating system drivers can.\nMMCs may be available in sizes up to 16 gigabytes (GB). They are used in almost every context in which memory cards are used, like cellular phones, digital audio players, digital cameras, and PDAs. Since the introduction of SD cards, few companies build MMC slots into their devices (an exception is some mobile devices like the Nokia 9300 communicator in 2004, where the smaller size of the MMC is a benefit), but the slightly thinner, pin-compatible MMCs can be used in almost any device that can use SD cards if the software/firmware on the device is capable.\nWhile few companies build MMC slots into devices as of 2018[update], due to SD cards dominating the memory card market, the embedded MMC (e.MMC) is still widely used in consumer electronics as a primary means of integrated storage and boot ROM[2] in portable devices. eMMC provides a low-cost[3] flash-memory system with a built-in controller that can reside inside an Android or Windows phone or in a low-cost PC and can appear to its host as a bootable device, in lieu of a more expensive form of solid-state storage, such as a traditional NVMe solid-state drive, UFS chip, or SD card.\nThe latest version of the eMMC standard (JESD84-B51) by JEDEC is version 5.1A, released January 2019, with speeds (250\u00a0MB/s read, 125\u00a0MB/s write) rivaling discrete SATA-based SSDs (400\u00a0MB/s).[4]\nUndersides of an MMC (left) and SD card (right) showing the differences between the two formats.\nContents\n1 Open standard\n2 Variants\n2.1 eMMC\n2.2 RS-MMC\n2.3 DV-MMC\n2.4 MMCplus and MMCmobile\n2.5 MMCmicro\n2.6 MiCard\n2.7 SecureMMC\n2.8 Others\n2.9 Table\n3 References\n4 External links\n4.1 Organizations\n4.2 Specifications\n4.3 Other\nOpen standard[edit]\nTop of four types of MMC cards (clockwise from left): MMC, RS-MMC, MMCplus, MMCmobile, metal extenderBottom of the same four cards\nAs of 23 September 2008, the MultimediaCard Association (MMCA) turned over all MMC specifications to the JEDEC organization including embedded MMC (e-MMC), SecureMMC, and miCARD assets.[5] JEDEC is an organization devoted to standards for the solid-state industry.\nThe latest e.MMC specifications, version 5.1, can be requested from JEDEC, free-of-charge for JEDEC members.[6] Older versions of the standard, as well as some optional enhancements to the standard such as MiCard and SecureMMC, must be purchased separately.\nWhile there is no royalty charged for devices to host an MMC or e.MMC, a royalty may be necessary in order to manufacture the cards themselves.\nA highly detailed datasheet[7] that contains essential information for writing an MMC host driver is available online.\nVariants[edit]\neMMC[edit]\neMMC KLMAG2GE4A-A002 inside the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1The currently implemented embedded MMC[8] (eMMC) architecture puts the MMC components (flash memory and controller) into a small ball grid array (BGA) IC package for use in circuit boards as an embedded non-volatile memory system. This is noticeably different from other versions of MMC as this is not a user-removable card, but rather a permanent attachment to the printed circuit board (PCB). Therefore, in the event of an issue with either the memory or its controller, the e.MMC would need to be replaced or repaired. In e.MMC, the host system simply reads and writes data to and from the logical block addresses. The e.MMC controller hardware and firmware lifts the burden on the host system by performing error correction and data management. e.MMC exists in 100, 153, 169 ball packages and is based on an 8-bit parallel interface.[9]\nAlmost all mobile phones and tablets used this form of flash for main storage until 2016, when Universal Flash Storage (UFS) started to take control of the market.\neMMC does not support the SPI-bus protocol and uses NAND flash.[10]\neMMC versions\nSequential Read\n(MB/s)\nSequential Write\n(MB/s)\nRandom Read\n(IO/s)\nRandom Write\n(IO/s)\nClock Frequency\n(Mhz)\nUsed in\neMMC 4.3\neMMC 4.4\neMMC 4.41\n52[11]\neMMC 4.5\n140[12]\n50\n7000\n2000\n200\nSnapdragon 800\neMMC 5.0\n250\n90\n7000\n13000\nSnapdragon 801\neMMC 5.1\n250\n125\n11000\n13000\nSnapdragon 820\nRS-MMC[edit]\nIn 2004, the Reduced-Size MultiMediaCard (RS-MMC) was introduced as a smaller form factor of the MMC, with about half the size: 24\u00a0mm \u00d7 18\u00a0mm \u00d7 1.4\u00a0mm. The RS-MMC uses a simple mechanical adapter to elongate the card so it can be used in any MMC (or SD) slot. RS-MMCs are currently available in sizes up to and including 2\u00a0GB.\nThe modern continuation of an RS-MMC is commonly known as MiniDrive (MD-MMC). A MiniDrive is generally a microSD card adapter in the RS-MMC form factor. This allows a user to take advantage of the wider range of modern MMCs available[13] to exceed the historic 2\u00a0GB limitations of older chip technology.\nImplementations of RS-MMCs include Nokia and Siemens, who used RS-MMC in their Series 60 Symbian smartphones, the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet, and generations 65 and 75 (Siemens). However, since 2006, all of Nokia's new devices with card slots have used miniSD or microSD cards, with the company dropping support for the MMC standard in its products. While Siemens exited the mobile phone business completely in 2006, the company continues to use MMC for some PLC storage leveraging MD-MMC advances.\nDV-MMC[edit]\nThe Dual-Voltage MultimediaCard (DV-MMC) was one of the first changes in MMC.[citation needed] These cards can operate at 1.8\u00a0V in addition to 3.3\u00a0V. Running at lower voltages reduces the card's energy consumption, which is important in mobile devices. However, simple dual-voltage parts quickly went out of production in favor of MMCplus and MMCmobile, which offer capabilities in addition to dual-voltage capability.\nMMCplus and MMCmobile[edit]\nThe version 4.x of the MMC standard, introduced in 2005, introduced two significant changes to compete against SD cards: (1) the ability to run at higher speeds (26\u00a0MHz and 52\u00a0MHz) than the original MMC (20\u00a0MHz) or SD (25\u00a0MHz, 50\u00a0MHz), and (2) a four- or eight-bit-wide data bus.\nVersion 4.x full-size cards and reduced-size cards can be marketed as MMCplus and MMCmobile, respectively.\nVersion 4.x cards are fully backward compatible with existing readers but require updated hardware and software to use their new capabilities. Even though the four-bit-wide bus and high-speed modes of operation are deliberately electrically compatible with SD, the initialization protocol is different, so firmware and software updates are required to use these features in an SD reader.\nMMCmicro[edit]\nMMCmicro\nMMCmicro is a smaller version of MMC. With dimensions of 14\u00a0mm \u00d7 12\u00a0mm \u00d7 1.1\u00a0mm, it is smaller and thinner than RS-MMC. Like MMCmobile, MMCmicro allows dual voltage, is backward compatible with MMC, and can be used in full-size MMC and SD slots with a mechanical adapter. MMCmicro cards have the high-speed and four-bit-bus features of the 4.x spec, but not the eight-bit bus, due to the absence of the extra pins.[14]\nThis variant was formerly known as S-card when introduced by Samsung on 13 December 2004. It was later adapted and introduced in 2005 by the MultiMediaCard Association (MMCA) as the third form factor memory card in the MultiMediaCard family.[15]\nMMCmicro appears very similar to microSD, but the two formats are not physically compatible and have incompatible pinouts.\nMiCard[edit]\nThe MiCard is a backward-compatible extension of the MMC standard with a theoretical maximum size of 2048\u00a0GB (2 tebibytes) announced on 2 June 2007. The card is composed of two detachable parts, much like a microSD card with an SD adapter. The small memory card fits directly in a USB port and has MMC-compatible electrical contacts. With an included electromechanical adapter, it can also fit in traditional MMC and SD card readers. To date, only one manufacturer (Pretec) has produced cards in this format.[16]\nThe MiCard was developed by the Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan. At the time of the announcement, twelve Taiwanese companies (including ADATA Technology, Asustek, BenQ, Carry Computer Eng. Co., C-One Technology, DBTel, Power Digital Card Co., and RiCHIP) had signed on to manufacture the new memory card. However, as of June 2011, none of the listed companies had released any such cards, nor had any further announcements been made about plans for the format.\nThe card was announced to be available starting in the third quarter of 2007. It was expected to save the 12 Taiwanese companies who planned to manufacture the product and related hardware up to US$40 million in licensing fees, which presumably would otherwise be paid to owners of competing flash memory formats. The initial card was to have a capacity of 8\u00a0GB, while the standard would allow sizes up to 2048\u00a0GB. It was stated to have data transfer speeds of 480\u00a0Mbit/s (60\u00a0Mbyte/s), with plans to increase data over time.\nSecureMMC[edit]\nAn additional, optional part of the MMC 4.x specification is a digital rights management (DRM) mechanism intended to enable MMC to compete with SD or Memory Stick. Very little information is known[citation needed] about how SecureMMC works or how its DRM characteristics compare with its competitors.\nOthers[edit]\nIn 2004, a group of companies\u2014including Seagate and Hitachi\u2014introduced an interface called CE-ATA for small form factor hard disk drives.[17] This interface was electrically and physically compatible with the MMC specification. However, support for further development of the standard ended in 2008.[18]\nThe game card format used on the PlayStation Vita was found to be based on the MMC standard, but with a different pinout and support for custom initialization commands as well as copy protection.[19]\nTable[edit]\nMain article: Comparison of memory cards\nComparison of technical features of MMC and SD card variantsvte\nType\nMMC\nRS-MMC\nMMCplus\nMMCmobile\nSecureMMC\nSDIO\nSD\nminiSD\nmicroSD\nSD-socket compatible\nYes\nExtender\nYes\nExtender\nYes\nYes\nYes\nAdapter\nAdapter\nPins\n7\n7\n13\n13\n7\n9\n9\n11\n8\nWidth\n24\u00a0mm\n24\u00a0mm\n24\u00a0mm\n24\u00a0mm\n24\u00a0mm\n24\u00a0mm\n24\u00a0mm\n20\u00a0mm\n11\u00a0mm\nLength\n32\u00a0mm\n18\u00a0mm\n32\u00a0mm\n18\u00a0mm\n32\u00a0mm\n32\u00a0mm+\n32\u00a0mm\n21.5\u00a0mm\n15\u00a0mm\nThickness\n1.4\u00a0mm\n1.4\u00a0mm\n1.4\u00a0mm\n1.4\u00a0mm\n1.4\u00a0mm\n2.1\u00a0mm\n2.1\u00a0mm (most)1.4\u00a0mm (rare)\n1.4\u00a0mm\n1\u00a0mm\n1-bit SPI-bus mode\nOptional\nOptional\nOptional\nOptional\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nMax SPI bus clock\n20\u00a0MHz\n20\u00a0MHz\n52\u00a0MHz\n52\u00a0MHz\n20\u00a0MHz\n50\u00a0MHz\n25\u00a0MHz\n50\u00a0MHz\n50\u00a0MHz\n1-bit MMC/SD bus mode\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n4-bit MMC/SD bus mode\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\nOptional\nYes\nYes\nYes\n8-bit MMC bus mode\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nDDR mode\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nUn\u00adknown\nUn\u00adknown\nUn\u00adknown\nUn\u00adknown\nUn\u00adknown\nMax MMC/SD bus clock\n20\u00a0MHz\n20\u00a0MHz\n52\u00a0MHz\n52\u00a0MHz\n20\u00a0MHz?\n50\u00a0MHz\n208\u00a0MHz\n208\u00a0MHz\n208\u00a0MHz\nMax MMC/SD transfer rate\n20\u00a0Mbit/s\n20\u00a0Mbit/s\n832\u00a0Mbit/s\n832\u00a0Mbit/s\n20\u00a0Mbit/s?\n200\u00a0Mbit/s\n832\u00a0Mbit/s\n832\u00a0Mbit/s\n832\u00a0Mbit/s\nInterrupts\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nOptional\nNo\nNo\nNo\nDRM support\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\u2014\nYes\nYes\nYes\nUser encrypt\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nSimplified spec.\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nUn\u00adknown\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nMembership cost\nJEDEC: US$4,400/yr, optional\nSD Card Association: US$2,000/year, general; US$4,500/year, executive\nSpecification cost\nFree\nUn\u00adknown\nSimplified: free.

It was first included in Windows Me on September 14, 2000 and in Windows XP on October 25, 2001. It was a part of the Windows Essentials software suite, and offered the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, Windows Live Groups, and Flickr. It is comparable to Apple\u2019s iMovie.\nMovie Maker was officially discontinued on January 10, 2017, and it is replaced by Video Editor (formerly Microsoft Story Remix) which is built in with Microsoft Photos on Windows 10, and Clipchamp on Windows 11, which Microsoft acquired in September 2021.\nContents\n1 History\n1.1 Initial releases\n1.2 Windows Vista\n1.3 Windows Live\n1.4 2012.1\n1.5 Discontinuation and replacements\n2 Layout\n2.1 Importing footage\n2.2 Editing and output\n2.3 Effects and transitions\n3 Reception and criticism\n4 Counterfeit versions\n5 See also\n6 References\n7 External links\nHistory[edit]\nInitial releases[edit]\nThe first release of Windows Movie Maker was included with Windows Me on September 14, 2000.\nVersion 1.1 was included in Windows XP a year later, and included support for creating DV AVI and WMV 8 files. Version 2.0 was released as a free update in November 2002, and added a number of new features. Version 2.1, a minor update, is included in Windows XP Service Pack 2. The Movie Maker in Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 had more transitions and support for DVD burning.\nWindows Vista[edit]\nThe next version of Movie Maker was released as part of Windows Vista and \u2013 like most Windows components \u2013 reported version number 6.0.6000, same as Windows Vista itself. It included new effects and transitions, support for playback on the Xbox 360,[7] and support for the DVR-MS file format that Windows Media Center records television in. The HD version in Premium and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista also added support for capturing from HDV camcorders. The capture wizard also created DVR-MS type files from HDV tapes. However, the Windows Vista version of Windows Movie Maker removed support for importing video from an analog video source such as an analog camcorder, VCR or from a webcam.[8]\nAs some older systems might not be able to run the new version of Windows Movie Maker, Microsoft also released an updated older version 2.6 for Windows Vista on Microsoft Download Centre. This version included the old effects and transitions, and is basically the same as Windows Movie Maker 2.1, but without the ability to capture video. Installation requires Windows Vista and is only intended for use on computers where the hardware accelerated version cannot be run.[9]\nA Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) version of Windows Movie Maker was also included in some development builds of Vista (at the time codenamed \"Longhorn\"), but was removed in the development reset in August 2004.[10] After the development reset, the interface for the WPF-based Windows Movie Maker was retained in Windows Vista.\nWindows Live[edit]\nA new version of the software, renamed Windows Live Movie Maker 2009, was released as a beta on September 17, 2008, and officially released as a standalone product through Windows Live Essentials suite on August 19, 2009. This was effectively a completely new application, as it could not read projects created by earlier versions and did not support custom XML transitions written for the previous versions. In addition, many features were removed.\nAlso, Movie Maker's interface was redesigned in the Windows Live version to use a ribbon toolbar similar to Office 2007; it also added features such as \"Auto Movie\" and the ability to export a videos directly to DVDs and YouTube.[11] Certain advanced features were also removed from the software, such as image stabilization and the ability to record voice-overs.[12]\nMovie Maker 2009 supported both Windows Vista and Windows 7. As the previous version of Windows Movie Maker was no longer included with the operating system, the only way to obtain Movie Maker on Windows 7 and later was through the Windows Live Essentials suite,[6][13] although some manufacturers pre-installed the application on new PCs.\nAn updated version, Windows Live Movie Maker 2011, was released on August 17, 2010, adding features such as webcam capture, support for high-definition video, the ability to upload videos directly to SkyDrive, Facebook, and YouTube through their respective web APIs, and the ability to add media files stored on network shares to projects.[12]\n2012.1[edit]\nWith the discontinuation of the Windows Live brand (and the re-branding of the Windows Live suite as Windows Essentials), Windows Movie Maker 2012 was released in April 2012. Support for recording voice-overs was restored, along with an audio mixer and integration with several free stock music services. H.264/MP4 became the default export format (replacing Windows Media Video, but still can be used), support for uploading to Vimeo was introduced (other sites were added to the list in the Windows 8.1 release of the suite), and hardware accelerated video pila stabilisation was also added as an exclusive feature for Windows 8 users.[14]\nDiscontinuation and replacements[edit]\nMovie Maker was officially removed for download on January 10, 2017. Like Windows Photo Gallery from Windows Essentials, Movie Maker is now replaced by the Microsoft Photos App included in Windows 10, which includes Video Editor (formerly Windows Story Remix).[15]\nOn September 8, 2021, Microsoft acquired Clipchamp, a web-based video editing app for an undisclosed amount,[16] and integrated it as part of Windows 11 on March 9, 2022. The newly-acquired video editing app reintroduces the timeline editing layout that had been previously removed in Windows Live Movie Maker, along with additional features including a text-to-speech generator powered by Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft OneDrive integration.[17] It is a freemium-based software.[18]\nAfter the initial criticism by many users since bundling into Windows 11 due to the maximum resolution that free plan users can export is 480p, Microsoft added the ability to export video at a maximum resolution of 1080p for free users on March 29, 2022.[19]\nLayout[edit]\nThe layout consists of a storyboard view and a timeline view, collections for organizing imported video, and a preview pane. When in Storyboard view, the video project appears as a film strip showing each scene in clips. The storyboard/timeline consists of one 'Video' (with accompanying 'Audio' bar), one 'Music/Audio' bar, and one 'Titles/Credits' bar. In each bar, clips can be added for editing (e.g., a .WAV music file will belong on the 'Music/Audio' bar). Still images can also be imported into the timeline and \"stretched\" to any desired number of frames. The Video and Music/Audio bars can be \"cut\" to any number of short segments, which will play together seamlessly, but the individual segments are isolated editing-wise, so that for example, the music volume can be lowered for just a few seconds while someone is speaking.\nImporting footage[edit]\nWhen importing footage into the program, a user can either choose to Capture Video (from camera, scanner or other device) or Import into Collections to import existing video files into the user's collections. The accepted formats for import are .WMV/.ASF, .MPG (MPEG-1), .AVI (DV-AVI), .WMA, .WAV, and .MP3. Additionally, the Windows Vista Home Premium and Ultimate editions of Movie Maker support importing MPEG-2 Program streams and DVR-MS formats.[20] Importing of other container formats such as MP4/3GP, FLV and MOV, and AAC are also supported if the necessary codecs are installed and the system is running Windows 7 or later.[21]\nIn the\nXP version, import and real-time capture of video from an analog source such as a VCR, tape-based analog camcorder or webcam is possible. This feature is based on Windows Image Acquisition. Video support in Windows Image Acquisition was removed in Windows Vista, as a result importing analog footage in Windows Movie Maker is no longer possible.[22]\nWhen importing from a DV tape, if the \"Make Clips on Completion\" option is selected, Windows Movie Maker automatically flags the commencement of each scene, so that the tape appears on the editing screen as a collection of short clips, rather than one long recording. That is, at each point where the \"Record\" button was pressed, a new \"clip\" is generated, although the actual recording on the hard drive is still one continuous file. This feature is also offered after importing files already on the hard drive. In the Windows Vista version, the \"Make clips on completion\" option has been removed \u2014 the clips are now automatically created during the capture process.\nThe efficiency of the importing and editing process is heavily dependent on the amount of file fragmentation of the hard disk. The most reliable results can be obtained by adding an extra hard disk dedicated for scratch space, and regularly re-formatting/defragmenting it, rather than simply deleting the files at the end of the project. Fragmented AVI files result in jerky playback on the editing screen, and make the final rendering process much longer.\nAlthough it is possible to import digital video from cameras through the USB interface, most older cameras only support USB version 1 and the results tend to be poor \u2014 \"sub VHS\" \u2014 quality. Newer cameras using USB 2.0 give much better results. A FireWire interface camera will allow recording and playback of images identical in quality to the original recordings if the video is imported and subsequently saved as DV AVI files, although this consumes disk space at about 1 gigabyte every five minutes (12\u00a0GB/Hr). Alternatively, most DV cameras allow the final AVI file to be recorded back onto the camera tape for high quality playback. Some standalone DVD recorders will also directly accept DV inputs from video cameras and computers.\nEditing and output[edit]\nAfter capture, any clip can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the timeline. Once on the timeline, clips can be duplicated, split, repositioned or edited. An AutoMovie feature offers predefined editing styles (titles, effects and transitions) for quickly creating movies.\nThe original camera file on the hard drive is not modified; the project file is just a list of instructions for reproducing a final output video file from the original file. Thus, several different versions of the same video can be simultaneously made from the original camera footage.\nEarlier versions of Windows Movie Maker could only export video in Windows Media Video or DV AVI formats.[23] It includes some predefined profiles, but users can also create custom profiles.[24] Windows XP Media Centre Edition bundled Sonic DVD Burning engine, licensed from Sonic Solutions, allowing video editors to burn their project in DVD-Video format on a DVD. In Windows Vista, Windows Movie Maker passes the video project to Windows DVD Maker.\nWindows Movie Maker 2012 introduced the default ability to export in H.264 MP4 format.\nVideo can be exported back to the video camera if supported by the camera. Movie Maker also allows users to publish a finished video on video hosting websites.\nWindows Movie Maker can also be used to edit and publish audio tracks. If no video or image is present, Movie Maker allows exporting the sound clips in Windows Media Audio format.\nEffects and transitions[edit]\nWindows Movie Maker supports a large variety of titles, effects and transitions.\nTitles are animated text screens, normally placed at the beginning or end of the movie, but can also be placed over video clips. Titles and credits can be added as stand alone titles or overlaying them on the clip by adding them onto the selected clip. Titles range from static (non-animated) titles to fly in, fading, news banner, or spinning newspaper animations. They can also be placed on video clips to create sub-titles.\nTransitions affect how one video clips flows into another. Examples include fade and dissolve, but many more spectacular transitions are available.\nEffects alter how a video clip appears. Example include allowing control of brightness, contrast or hue, but other more dramatic effects are available, such as giving an 'old time' flickering black and white feel.\nVersions 2.x included in Windows XP includes 60 transitions, 37 effects, 34 title and 9 credits animations. The Windows Vista version includes a different set of transitions, effects and title/credits animations while dropping a few older ones. There are in all 49 effects and 63 transitions. They are applied by using a drag and drop interface from the effects or transitions folders.\nEarly versions (V2 onwards) of Windows Movie Maker had a flexible interface so programming custom effects and other content were possible via XML. The Windows Vista version supports Direct3D-based effects. Microsoft also provides SDK documentation for custom effects and transitions.[25] Since the effects are XML based, users could create and add custom effects and transitions of their own with XML knowledge.\nMany custom transitions were commercially available and created additional features such as picture-in-picture.\nWindows Movie Maker V6 did not support customisations to effects and transitions in the same way as V2.x and so many customisations had to be re-written. Versions after V6 do not support custom transitions and effects at all.\nReception and criticism[edit]\nMovie Maker 1.0, introduced with Windows Me, was widely criticized for being \"bare bones\"[26] and suffering \"a woeful lack of features\";[27] and saving movies only in Microsoft's ASF file format.[28] Critical reception of versions 2.0 and 2.6 has been slightly more positive.[27]\nMany longstanding users were disappointed by the removal of so many features in the effective re-writing of the software in Live Movie Maker 2009. Some of those features (such as visualisation of the audio levels) have subsequently been re-added.\nIn June 2008, a memo purportedly by Bill Gates from January 2003 was circulated on the Internet in which he heavily criticized the downloading process for Movie Maker at the time.[29] The memo was originally made available online as part of the plaintiffs' evidence in Comes v. Microsoft Corp., an antitrust class-action suit, and was submitted as evidence in that case on January 16, 2007.[30]\nCounterfeit versions[edit]\nThe discontinuation of Windows Movie Maker has led to the appearance of scams abusing its name. In late 2016, a few months before the discontinuation of the Windows Essentials suite (including Movie Maker), a website named windows-movie-maker.org (no longer accessible) which offered a tampered version of Windows Movie Maker, appeared as one of the top results when searching for \"Movie Maker\" and \"Windows Movie Maker\" on Google and Bing, a scam only widely recognized as such in 2017.[31] It was identical to the real Windows Movie Maker, however, unlike the official and free Windows Movie Maker by Microsoft, it would not let users save a video without purchasing. Upon installing and executing the program, the user was greeted with a dialogue box explaining that it was a trial and a purchase was required. ESET also detected a malware called Win32/Hoax.MovieMaker in the above-mentioned version. The fake will also restrict the installation of the WLE (Windows Live Essentials) Movie Maker by modifying the Windows registry.[32]\nSee also[edit]\nAdobe Premiere Pro\n3D Movie Maker\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Windows Live Downloads - Version 2\".

Each piece is absolutely unique. When you wear a fingerprint necklace, pendant, or charm - you carry your loved one with you and celebrate a treasured relationship.\nWhat is Fingerprint Jewelry? \u00a0Fingerprint jewelry is a one-of-a-kind way to mark a special relationship, capturing the fingerprint or thumbprint of your loved one in a piece of jewelry or keepsake that you can keep with you at all times. You can even use the paw print and/or nose print of your beloved pet! We cast or etch the print directly onto silver or gold on the custom-designed pieces. We're also happy to engrave your jewelry for free, making this an ideal choice when you want a unique way to commemorate a birth, a memorial of a life well lived, a graduation, a wedding, or when you simply want to treasure a memory or special relationship. We can also add birthstones and other precious stones to your fingerprint jewelry.\nEach keepsake is one-of-a-kind and custom-crafted piece of art, because we know that we're making something that you'll treasure. Imagine running your fingers over the ridges of the actual fingerprint of someone you love \u2014 mothers and children can exchange fingerprint jewelry as a sign of that special bond between them, and couples often give each other fingerprint rings or necklaces as a way of staying together even when they're apart. Many of our customers purchase fingerprint memorial jewelry to hand down as a family heirloom.\nHow Do We Create this Unique Wearable Art? \u00a0Each piece of jewelry starts with you taking an ink imprint of your own finger or that of a loved one. We recommend using the thumb for best results. We digitize those impressions and turn them over to skilled artisans that use the ancient art of \"Lost Wax Casting\" creating the unique piece of memorial jewelry. It takes several weeks for our craftspeople to create the keepsake.\u00a0We protect the security of the fingerprints you send by digitizing them and keeping the files safe. We keep them in our secure files so that you can re-order any necklace, pendant or ring with the same print when the occasion calls for it.\nAllow at least 3 weeks to receive your jewelry from the date that we receive the prints.\nAdditional Information\nFAQs and additional details\nFingerprint portraits gallery\nBrowse Products\n63 Item(s)\nSort By\nPosition\nName\nPrice\nStarting

Check out\nthis wonderful guide\nby our\ncommunity member\n@opt1m3.\nDo I need to hold the Lifetime/Founding Membership token in the same wallet\nthat I use on OpenSea?\nNo, you only need to connect with the wallet holding the\ntoken,after which you'll\nget a cookie that lasts for 28 days that grants access to that browser regardless of which wallet\nyou have connected on OpenSea.\nWhat do the different rarity colors mean?\nLegendary (Orange), top 0.1%\nEpic (Purple), top 1%\nRare (Blue), top 10%\nUncommon (Green), top 50%\nCommon (White/Gray), bottom 50%\nYou can hover the rank to see what rarity the color represents, or click on it to get a\nbreakdown of the rank.\nWill SuperSea ever work on other platforms (e.g. Coinbase NFT, LooksRare)?\nWe intend to build our tools for the platform where the\nmajority of trading happens. If someone dethrones OpenSea from that position, then that's where we\nwill divert our attention. Your membership will stay valid for whatever we build on these new\nplatforms.\nIs the extension safe to use?\nThe most important thing to understand when it comes to\nthe security of your MetaMask wallet is that malicious code can never send a transaction for you,\nwithout you first having confirmed it in the MetaMask popup window. As such, our extension (or any\nother website) can never directly extract money from your wallet without your interaction. A couple\nmore points on the safety of our code:\nChrome Web Store reviews every extension that is listed to keep bad actors away\nAll of the code is open and available to view on\nGitHub\nOur extension never executes any remote code, so there's no attack vector for\noutside parties to inject anything malicious\nYou also have an option of playing it safe by using the SuperSea extension in a completely\nisolated Chrome profile which doesn't have MetaMask installed.\nHow long does it take for a collection to get ranked after reveal?\nOnce a collection has uploaded their metadata, you can\nrequest it to be ranked with our ranking command\n/request <opensea_url> in the\n#ranking-requests channel in our Discord. You\ncan also queue it up to automatically rank it after detecting the reveal has happened, with /queue-unrevealed <opensea_url>. If the metadata is\nhosted in a location where our servers can download it quickly, the ranking process should only take\na few seconds.\nWhy does the rank differ from [ranking service]?\nOur rarity ranks are generated by a standardized scoring algorithm\nbased purely on the traits in the NFTs metadata. We also take in to account the trait count, which\nis usually what collections on rarity.tools do as well.\nSuperSea is not an official authority for the rarity of NFTs\n. Please understand that our reported rank could be inaccurate for a number of reasons:\nThere's a bug in our code.\nThe collection has been ranked before all metadata was revealed.\nThe collection had its metadata updated after we ranked it.\nThe community does not consider a standardized scoring algorithm based on\ncombined trait rarity to be an accurate representation of what is a sought-after item in the\ngiven collection.\nNever make a purchasing decision based on our reported rank alone,\nalways do your own due diligence. We recommend you to use the score breakdown, accessed by\nclicking the rank text, to judge if we've produced a reasonable rank based on the traits.\nCan I claim two free Lifetime Tokens if I buy a Founding Membership Token\nfrom OpenSea?\nYou'll have to check in the contract if the claims are\nstill available for that token, go to\nour\ncontract on Etherscan\nand enter the id of the founder token in input field under\n6. checkClaimedForMembership.\nThe Team\nJoel Besada\nEngineering / Design\nPreviously a Staff Software Engineer at Shopify (not to be confused\nwith Spotify), Joel is now a free agent fully dedicated to building cool new things on the internet \u2014\nlike SuperSea!\nRobin Bj\u00f6rklund\nEngineering / Design\nPreviously a Software Engineer at Spotify (to indeed be confused with\nSpotify), Robin is also an independent developer currently exploring the depths of web 3.0.\nThe information provided by SuperSea does not constitute investment, trading\nor financial advice.

If you don't have one, you must buy one. Nintendo says there's a good reason for that. Whatever that reason is, it's not fair.Watch\nCCOffEnglishThe Week In Games: Holiday Season Edition01:28Now playing\nMythic Quest\u2019s Charlotte Nicdao On How Gaming Is Like ActingFriday 2:36PM02:50Now playing\nThe Week In Games: High On WitchcraftDecember 13, 2022 \tThe New Nintendo 3DS is an updated version of the 3DS, and it's truly a fantastic handheld. I cannot recommend it enough. I also recommend that Nintendo put AC adapters in the box when it releases the NN3DS XL, but their failure to do so is not a deal breaker (though it is annoying).Nintendo's New 3DS is Their Best Handheld YetYou probably don't need to be told this, but Nintendo's New 3DS is their best yet. More than that\u2026Read moreAdvertisement \tThe Kyoto-based game maker explained its rationale to IGN: \"New Nintendo 3DS XL uses the same AC adapter as any Nintendo 3DS or Nintendo DSi system. Rather than raise the cost of New Nintendo 3DS XL by charging consumers for a component they may already own, we are giving them the option to only buy if they need an AC adapter.\"$20 offXbox Wireless ControllerFor Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, & Windows devicesThe new Xbox Wireless Controller feels natural with its lightweight design, textured triggers, and hybrid D-pad. It\u2019s also Bluetooth-enabled, making it easy to switch over to your computer.Buy for $40 at Best BuyAdvertisement \t[Photo: NK_AraHaBaki] \tFor years now, Nintendo has been doing this in Japan\u2014and in the past, Japanese players would complain about how Nintendo included plugs with Western portables, but stiffed the domestic market. That being said, the fact that many Nintendo handhelds don't come with something as basic as an AC adapter still surprises people in Japan. Even if the packaging does point out that the handheld needs a power plug, it seems like someone people just assume that, you know, it would.Advertisement \t\"This 3DS doesn't come with a power plug?\" wrote one Twitter user last December. \"Santa brought a 3DS and Yokai Watch 2: Shinuchi to my son,\" wrote another on Christmas Day. \"But, it doesn't come with an AC adapter?!\" Getting a present and then realizing you need to buy a plug so it'll keep working\u2014what a drag! \tBack when the Nintendo 3DS XL was released in 2012 in Japan, it did not come with an AC adapter (ditto for Europe, it seems). Nintendo explained that the reason was, \"We won't make you pay for something you don't need.\"Advertisement \tBut... it's the plug that powers the hardware. You need it. More unsettling was the fact that the 3DS XL was sold in North America with an AC adapter. That's the sticking point that makes Nintendo's current claims ring false: In the past, it's included an AC adapter, so why stop?Advertisement \t[Photo: mucom88] \tNintendo is making an assumption that people who purchase the New Nintendo 3DS already have an AC adapter. In Japan, the plug came with the DSi and the smaller 3DS, but it did not come with the 3DS XL as well as both New Nintendo 3DS sizes.Advertisement \tThe odd thing is that Nintendo is actually punishing people who are not early adopters. So, if you bought an original-size Nintendo 3DS, then you got a plug. But if you waited for the XL, too bad.Advertisement \tOr maybe you really waited and didn't own a DSi or a regular-sized 3DS, but had a DS Lite? Well, you can't use a DS Lite plug with the 3DS handhelds. You must buy a plug. Nintendo sells them for 925 yen (around US$8)\u2014which makes me wonder how much the AC adapter is really worth or how much it costs Nintendo to manufacture them. Other companies seem perfectly capable of including cables to power their machines, why isn't Nintendo? \tIt's really the principle of the matter that's so disconcerting. This is like ordering a meal in a restaurant and then being told there's a surcharge if you need eating utensils. Nintendo shouldn't be making the decision of what I don't need and be considerate enough to think, hey, maybe this customer will need a plug to power this new hardware.Advertisement \t[Photo: SollairoDays] \tSure, some gamers will already have an adapter, but maybe they want another one. I know in my house we have multiple Nintendo handhelds owned but different family members, but a short supply of plugs. That kinda sucks.Advertisement \tNintendo may say it's not passing along charges to the consumer or that it's saving the consumer money. Actually, Nintendo is saving Nintendo money. Nintendo is thinking about what's best for Nintendo. \tAnd this isn't new. The company has been pulling this kind of stuff for years. This ad for 1977's Color TV-Game Block Breaker states that dedicated AC adapters are sold separately at 1,500 yen (around $13)\na pop. (More here on BeforeMario.com.)Advertisement \t[Photo via million7000] \tWell, at least now, Nintendo is charging less money for them.Advertisement \t[Photo: BeforeMario.com]To contact the author of this post, write to bashcraftATkotaku.com or find him on Twitter @Brian_Ashcraft.AdvertisementKotaku East is your slice of Asian internet culture, bringing you the latest talking points from Japan, Korea, China and beyond.

You don't need to install special add-ins in Outlook to send text messages, but the recipient will need text messaging enabled on their cellular plan (most carriers enable it by default) and have a phone capable of receiving text messages (most new phones are text-capable).To use, compose a short email message using less than 160 total characters in Outlook (or any email client) and address it to the cellular number at the carrier's email domain. Remember to remove your signature from the message before sending.

If they send attachments, do not open them. if they send links to attachments, do not click. If you receive an email that says you need to reset a password, type the url to the site in the browser and check it out (if its legit, the site should make you change the password). You can drag the message to the junk mail folder and view the message as plain text - this makes it easy to see the actual URLs.\n00\nReply\nTodd\u00a0(@guest_203362)\nDecember 12, 2016 2:11 pm\n#203362\nHi Diane, until today, I've been successfully receiving/replying to SMS in Outlook 2010 (via hosted MS Exchange Service). I've got android phone Galaxy Note 5, with ATT mobile service. Don't know how this got set up, but it just worked. (No third party OMS.) I cleared passwords and cache on my computer yesterday.

Many will include the service that \"owns\" the 3 digit city code.

The \"wow\" in KDwow stands for World of Warcraft, which was the game which got me into livestreaming back in August 2015.\nI went on to build an online stream community, first on Twitch.tv/kdwow and then Chaturbate.com/kdwow\nThere are now collectively around 500k members of my community across Twitch, Chaturbate, YouTube & other Social Media.\nMY CONTENT\nOn Twitch I create strictly SFW gaming content.\nMy OnlyFans page is where I post all of my latest NSFW content * where I talk to my fans the most!\nMy older videos are available to my Fan Club on Chaturbate or some you can \u00a0also purchase for tokens. \u00a0Some of my videos are also on ManyVids.\nA LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME\nI've always been a fun, kind, loving, and compassionate human, however, I do have a brain that sometimes behaves strangely due to ADHD and Bipolar Disorder and PTSD.\nIt's honestly just also my naturally eccentric, bold, and nerdy personality though that seems to set me apart from others the most. I never seemed to fit into society and as I get older and wiser I enjoy that more and more. Society isn't really somewhere I even want to be accepted anymore lol and maybe I never did.\nI can definitely be toxic like anyone else but I make a big effort to be continually working to improve my mental health so that I can be the kind and joyful person I always feel that I am inside. I have a therapist and psychiatrist as well as a dietician who are working hard with me to give myself the best future possible. \ud83e\udd70\nYou can read my full life story here: GoogleDocs\nThanks for visiting my site!Have a wonderful day!\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 KDwow - All Rights Reserved.Powered by GoDaddy"

Revised (IES-R) for DSM-IV\nShare this page\nImpact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) for DSM-IV\nWeiss, & Marmar, 1996\nTo Obtain Scale\nDescription\nNOTE: This measure was based on DSM-III (IES) and DSM-IV (IES-R) criteria for PTSD. See a list of all measures, including those updated to DSM-5.\nThe IES-R is a 22-item self-report measure (for DSM-IV) that assesses subjective distress caused by traumatic events. It is a revised version of the older version, the 15-item IES (Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979). The IES-R contains 7 additional items related to the hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD, which were not included in the original IES. Items correspond directly to 14 of the 17 DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. The IES-R has not been updated to match the DSM-5, so it does not include items to full assess negative alterations in cognition and mood, for instance. Respondents are asked to identify a specific stressful life event and then indicate how much they were distressed or bothered during the past seven days by each \"difficulty\" listed.\nScoring\nItems are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (\"not at all\") to 4 (\"extremely\"). The IES-R yields a total score (ranging from 0 to 88) and subscale scores can also be calculated for the Intrusion, Avoidance, and Hyperarousal subscales. The authors recommend using means instead of raw sums for each of these subscales scores to allow comparison with scores from the Symptom Checklist 90 - Revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis, 1994). In general, the IES-R (and IES) is not used to diagnosis PTSD.\nSample Item\n\"Any reminders brought back feelings about it.\" (Respondents rate their degree of distress during the past 7 days on a 5-point scale.)\nVersions\nThe 15-item IES is the original scale but is missing DSM-IV hyperarousal symptoms (Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979).\nReferences\nWeiss, D.

The volume of blood which a person pumps out each minute tells whether the person has a properly\nfunctioning and normal heart or one that is not.\nThe 2 variables which determine the cardiac output are the person's heart rate and stroke volume.\nHeart rate is the number of times in 1 minute that a person's heart beats. It is measured in unit beats/min.\nStroke volume is the volume of blood which a person's heart pumps out per beat. It is measured in unit mL/beat. If you need to know how to calculate\nstroke volume first before calculating the cardiac output, see the Stroke\nVolume Calculator.\nWhen multiplied together (heart rate and stroke volume), the unit output resultant will be in mL/min, since beats/min * mL/beat\nyields mL/min.\nIncreasing either factor will increase cardiac output, since both have a direct relationship.\nTo use this calculator, a user just enters in the heart rate and stroke volume and clicks 'Calculate'. The cardiac output will\nthen automatically be calculated in unit mL/min.\nWhen a person is normally at rest, the average heart rate is 70 beats/min and the average stroke volume is 70mL/beat. Therefore, the\naverage amount of blood being pumped is 4900-5000mL/min at rest. During rigorous exercise, this amount increases dramatically. For one, a person's heart\nbeats rapidly during exercise, so the typical 70 beats/min can turn into 200 beats/min or even more. Your body also pumps out more blood. During\nexercise, your body uses up oxygen more rapidly. Since blood transports oxygen throughout the body, it needs to be pumped and circulated more\nrigorously throughout the body during exercise. So a person can pump as much as 35,000mL of blood per minute during intense exercise.\nThe electronic device, a pacemaker, may be used to stimulate heart beats in individuals who have irregular heart beat, which is why it is pictured above.\nExample Calculation\nIf a person has a heart rate of 70 beats/min and a stroke volume of 70mL/beat, what is the cardiac output of this individual?\nSo based on the values of the parameters, we use the equation CO= HR * SV and substitute in the values into the equation.\nCO= 70 * 70= 4900 mL/min\n\ufeff\nHome |\nArticles |\nProjects |\nProgramming |\nCalculators |\nContact\n\u00a9 2018 All Rights Reserved"

        "legitimate": "Brainfuck Developer - a Brainfuck IDE\nHome\nBrainfuck Developer\nWhat is it?\nBrainfuck Developer is a Win32 tool for writing,\ndebugging, and (in\nsome degree) understanding Brainfuck programs. Its main feature is\nan integrated debugger with support for\nsingle-step trace, run-to-cursor, and interactive memory inspection. It is\na development tool, not only a simple interpreter.\nWith the \"Watch Program Operation\" feature, you can watch your BF code\nrunning to go get an impression what your program does. In addition, BFdev features \"piping\" input and output data to files. You can set an input file from which the input data is read, and an output file to which all output data is written (in binary).\nGiven this ability, BFdev is just as powerful as console interpreters.\nSince version 1.4.0, BFdev supports the pbrain (procedural\nbrainfuck) language extension. This extension adds three new commands to\nthe BF language (as explained below). A very useful feature\nintegrated in BFdev since version 1.4.6 is the Text Generator, a tool\nthat generates BF code for printing text.\nThere is nothing to say about how BFdev works. Everyone who has\nalready worked with an IDE like Visual Studio, Delphi, or Turbo\nPascal knows the basic functioning of BFdev. (To those who have\nnot: do you really wanna code Brainfuck? ;) All of the program's\nfunctions are self-explanatory.\nThe screenshot to the right shows BFdev in debug mode, running \"factor.b\"\nby Brian Raiter.\nTechnical details\nFor Brainfuck programs, the interpreter provides the following\n\"virtual machine\":\nMemory size: 32768 cells \u00e0 8 bit or 16 bit (selectable)\nIf the pointer leaves the legal memory bounds (underflow or\noverflow), wrap-around occurs.\nProcedural BF (pbrain) is supported. Stack size is 65536.\nBF interpreters often have a \"bracket nesting limit\". BFdev does not. It\nsupports an infinite number of nested brackets (only limited by your\navailable RAM).\nThe interpreter ignores all characters in the code that are not\nBrainfuck commands.\nComplete lines can be commented out by using\none of the following comment markers. They MUST be the first\nnon-whitespace character of the line. Comment markers may be disabled.\nComment markers are: ; / * ' % #\nBFdev utilizes buffered output for printing. This\nincreases performance since the slow API calls don't have to be made each time a\nsingle character is printed. Buffering may cause the output appear choppy,\nespecially on slow computers. If a BF program is very slow, it may appear\nhanging, but that's generally not the case. The characters it prints are\njust not immediately shown on screen! You can change the buffer size or disable\nit by choosing \"Set Output Buffer Size\" in the \"Extras\" menu. Additionally, you\ncould press F8 to pause the program and to flush the output buffer.\nPrograms can indicate a new line by printing the characters LF (#10),\nCRLF (#13#10), CR (#13), or LFCR (#10#13).\nUnder Windows XP, BFdev runs optimal. Under Windows 95/98, BFdev cannot\nproduce output greater than 64 KB. This is due to limitations of the operating\nsystem (the Windows 95/98 multiline edit component is restricted to 64 KB).\nDownload\nBrainfuck Developer is freeware. That means, you may distribute it\nfreely, but only in \"complete and unchanged state\" and NOT ON YOUR OWN WEBSITE.\nBFdev is \"complete\" with\nthe three files bfdev.exe, printer.b, and readme.txt, bundled in the original\nbfdev.zip file. FREEWARE DOES NOT MEAN PUBLIC DOMAIN OR OPEN SOURCE. I hold\nall rights.\nWhy isn't BFdev open source? I cannot release BFdev as open source since the code\nis an embarassment for me.\nBFdev started as a very small project and was not meant to grow as it finally did.\nI added more and more functionality, but the architecture was not really capable\nof supporting this. The program appears small, but internally, there's more code than one\nmight think. Bad code, unfortunately. I feel pain when looking at it.\nI should rewrite the whole thing.\nTo webmasters: DO NOT link to the zip-files directly and\nDO NOT upload the files to your webserver! Instead, link to 4mhz.de or\n4mhz.de/bfdev.html. Thanks.\nFeedback is always appreciated, especially if you\nencounter any bugs or have any ideas for the next version.\nImportant for programmers: If you write a program like\n,>, and enter a text like \"a\", please don't be confused if BFdev\nonly asks for just one input instead of two! This is NO BUG, it's a feature.\nIn text input mode, BFdev may append a new-line code to your input, so that the\nsecond , reads this new-line code. You can change this behaviour\nin the \"Interpreter\" menu. (Well... given this explanation, I hope no one\nwill complain anymore...)\nbfdev-1-4-7.zip\n(Win32 binary, 419 KB, MD5: 93ed1dfc4918c7ced7457e4a5297d972)\nbfdev-1-4-7.rar\n(Win32 binary, 331 KB, MD5: b5e67e66b74c98e60bfa3befdf863c68)\nSome hints for using BFdev\nIf you want to print large amounts of text, use the Text Generator tool\nintegrated in BFdev (in the \"Extras\" menu).\nSome programs run faster in 8-bit mode; others gain better precision in\n16-bit mode. You have to check which mode performs better.\nUse Ctrl+F5 and Ctrl+F6 or Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab to switch between\nopen documents.\nSome authors write their BF programs in such a way that they expect\na CRLF line break rather than the standard LF when requesting input from the user.\nBy default, BFdev sends an LF. If the BF program you're running doesn't behave\nas expected, try switching BFdev to \"Report CRLF for line breaks when entering\ntext\" in the \"Extras\" menu.\nInfrequently, BF programs loaded from the internet don't work correctly.\nThis is because some authors use comment markers for design purposes\nso that some code lines are not executed by BFdev. In this case, you can\ndisable comment markers by unchecking the \"Enable comment markers\" entry in\nthe \"Extras\" menu.\nIf you input text lines with standard configuration, a line break is appended\nto every line of text you type. You can enter single characters by switching\nline breaks off in the \"Extras\" menu (\"Report no Line Break\")\nThe pbrain language extension\npbrain means\n\"procedural brainfuck\" and enables you to define and call procedures\nin your BF programs. For this purpose, pbrain adds three new commands to the BF\nlanguage: \"(\", \")\", and \":\".\n\"(\" starts definition of a procedure. This newly created procedure will be\nreferenced with the value that's in the current memory cell.\n\")\" ends the definition.\n\":\" calls that procedure that is referenced by the current memory cell.\nBFdev does not tolerate calling of undefined procedures. In this case, it\nwill report an error. BFdev offers a stack of 65536 entries, that means you can nest\nprocedures until a depth of 65536. There is no stack overflow checking. This\ndoesn't mean BFdev crashes if the stack grows too big, but instead,\nyour program crashes and you probably wouldn't know why. The IDE itself\ndoesn't crash when the stack overflows (I cared for this).\nYou can enable or disable pbrain support by checking or unchecking \"Enable\nProcedural BF\" in the \"Interpreter\" menu, by pressing Ctrl+P, or by clicking\nthe pbrain button in the tool bar.\nVersion history\nBrainfuck links\nhttp://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/\nThis is a very informative Brainfuck page.

        "legitimate": "International Lunar Network - Wikipedia\nInternational Lunar Network\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigation\nJump to search\nProposed set of robotic sensing stations on the Moon\nThe International Lunar Network or ILN was a proposed network of lunar surface stations to be built by the United States and the other space-faring countries in the 2010s. Each of these stations would act as a node in a lunar geophysical network. Ultimately this network could comprise 8-10 or more nodes operating simultaneously. Each node would have a minimum of two core capabilities. These capabilities include seismic sensing, heat flow sensing, and laser retroreflectors, and would be specific to each station.\nBecause some nodes were planned to be located on the far side of the Moon, NASA would have contributed a communications relay satellite to the project.[1] Individual nodes launched by different space agencies could have carried additional, unique experiments to study local or global lunar science. Such experiments might include atmospheric and dust instruments, plasma physics investigations, astronomical instruments, electromagnetic profiling of lunar regolith and crust, local geochemistry, and in-situ resource utilization demonstrations.[1]\nContents\n1 History\n2 Payload\n3 Status\n4 References\n5 External links\nHistory[edit]\nOn July 24, 2008 a meeting of the space agencies of Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States was held at NASA's Lunar Science Institute, located at the Ames Research Center. During the meeting, the representatives of the nine space agencies discussed about the cooperation on ILN and agreed on a statement of intent as a first step in planning. NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) agreed to provide two pairs of nodes (landed stations) for this network.\nPayload[edit]\nThe planned scientific payloads included:[2]\nseismometers\nmagnetometers\nlaser retroreflectors\nsubsoil thermal probes\nStatus[edit]\nThe network was not developed. The first two nodes were suggested to be launched in 2013 and 2014, with the second pair being launched some time between 2016 and 2017.[3]\nReferences[edit]\n^ a b \"International Lunar Network\".

        "legitimate": "Kids.Net.Au - Encyclopedia > Impact event\nSearch the Kids Internet\nEncyclopedia > Impact event\nArticle Content\nImpact event\nImpact events are caused by the collision of large meteoroids, asteroids or comets with Earth and may sometimes be followed by mass extinctions of life.\nFor discussion of impacts in general, not just on Earth, see crater.\nTable of contents\n1\nThe geology of Earth impacts\n2\nMass extinctions and impacts\n3\nRecent pre-historic impact events\n4\nModern impact events\n5 External links\n6 Further Reading\nThe geology of Earth impacts\nCenturies ago, the Western vision of the past saw an Earth that had been created a few thousand years ago, and had been shaped since that time by a number of global cataclysms (see catastrophism). This view gradually gave way to the consensus that the Earth was several billion years old, and that its features reflected the slow processes of gradual change.\nSince 1970, this view has gradually expanded to accommodate the fact that the Earth has in fact gone through periods of abrupt and catastrophic change due to the impact of large asteroids and comets on the planet. A few of these impacts may have caused massive climate change and the extermination of large numbers of plants and animals.\nThe fact that this modified view of the Earth's history did not emerge until recently seems surprising. Based on crater formation rates determined from our closest celestial partner, Luna, astronomers have determined that during the last 600 million years the Earth has been struck by 60 objects larger than 5 kilometers or more across. The smallest size of these impactors would release the equivalent of 10 million megatons of TNT and leave a crater 95 kilometers across.\nMass extinctions and impacts\nIn the past 600 million years there have been 5 major mass extinctions that on average extinguished half of all species. The last such mass extinction led to the demise of the dinosaurs and has been found to have coincided with a large asteroid impact; this is the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event.\nEvidence is also mounting that other mass extinctions may also have been caused or at least assisted by large impacts. The largest mass extinction to have affected life on Earth was the Permo-Triasic one that ended the Permian Period 250 million years ago and killed-off 90% of all species.\nIn 1980 Luis Alvarez[?] and his son Walter[?] led a team from the University of California at Berkeley that discovered unusually high concentrations of iridium, an element that is rare in he Earth's crust but relatively abundant in many meteorites From the amount and distribution of iridium present in the 65 million year old \"iridium layer\" , the Alvarez team later estimated that an asteroid of 10-14 kilometers must have collided with the earth. This iridium layer at the C-T boundary has been found worldwide at 100 different sites. Multidirectionaly shocked quartz, which is only known to form as the result of large impacts, has also been found in the same layer at more than 30 sites.\nSoot[?] and ash at levels tens of thousands times normal levels were found with the above.\nAnomalies in chromium isotopic ratios found within the C-T boundary layer strongly support the impact theory. Chromium isotopic ratios are homogeneous within the earth, therefore this isotopic anomalies exclude a volcanic origin which was also proposed as a cause for the iridium enrichment. Furthermore the chromium isotopic ratios determined in the C-T boundary are similar to the chromium isotopic ratios found in carbonaceus chondrites[?]. Thus a probable candidate for the impactor is a carbonaceous asteroid but also a comet is possible because comets are assumed to consist of material similar to carbonaceous chondrites[?].\nProbably the most convincing evidence for a worldwide catastrophe was the discovery of the crater which has since been named Chicxulub Crater. This so-called smoking gun is centered on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and was discovered by Tony Camargo and Glen Pentfield while working as geophysicists for the Mexican oil company PEMEX[?]. What they reported as a circular feature later turned out to be a crater estimated to be 180 kilometers in diameter. Other researchers would later find that the end-Cretaceous extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs had lasted for thousands of years instead of millions of years as had previously been thought. This would be the final piece of evidence that convinced the vast majority of scientists that this extinction resulted from a point event that is most probably an extra-terrestrial impact and not from increased volcanism and climate change (which would spread its main effect over a much longer time period).\nIt was the lack of high concentrations iridium and shocked quartz which has prevented the acceptance of the idea that the Permian extinction (so-called mother of mass extinctions) was also caused by an impact.\nHowever, during the late Permian all the continents were combined into one supercontinent named Pangaea and all the oceans formed one superocean, Panthalassa. If an impact occurred in the ocean and not on land at all, then there would be little shocked quartz released (since oceanic crust has relatively little silica) and much less material\nAlthough there is now general agreement that there was a huge impact at the end of the Cretaceous that led to the iridium enrichment of the K-T boundary layer, remnants have been found of other impacts of the same order of magnitude that did not result in any mass extinctions, and in fact there is no clear linkage between an impact and any other incident of mass extinction.\nNonetheless it is now widely believed, if a little on faith, that mass extinctions due to impacts are an occasional event in the history of the Earth. Indeed, in the early history of the Earth, about four billion years ago, they were almost certainly common since the skies were far more full of \"junk\" than at present. Such impacts could have included strikes by asteroids hundreds of kilometers in diameter, with explosions so powerful that they vaporized all the Earth's oceans. It was not until this \"hard rain\" began to slacken, so it seems, that life could have begun to evolve on Earth.\nRecent pre-historic impact events\nIn addition to the extremely large impacts that happen every few tens of millions of years, there are many smaller impacts that occur much more frequently but which leave correspondingly smaller traces behind. Due to the strong forces of erosion at work on Earth, only relatively recent examples of these smaller impacts are known. A few of the more famous or interesting examples are:\nBarringer Crater, the first crater to be proven the result of an impact\nthe Rio Cuarto craters, produced by an asteroid striking Earth at a very low angle\nthe Wabar craters, which apparently formed within the past few hundred years.\nModern impact events\nThe most significant recorded impact in recent times occurred at Tunguska in Russia, in 1908; see that article for more details. But although the Tunguska event was both spectacular and unparalleled in any historical record, it no longer seems as unique and unusual as it once did. We now know that Earth impacts, fairly big ones, are happening all the time.\nThe late Eugene Shoemaker of the US Geological Survey came up with an estimate of the rate of Earth impacts, and suggested that an event about the size of the nuclear weapon that destroyed Hiroshima occurs about once a year. Such events would seem to be spectacularly obvious, but they generally go unnoticed for a number of reasons: the majority of the Earth's surface is covered by water; a good portion of the land surface is uninhabited; and the explosions generally occur at relatively high altitude, resulting in a huge flash and thunderclap but no real damage.\nSome of have been observed, such as the Revelstoke[?] fireball of 1965, which occurred over the snows of northern Canada. Another fireball blew up over the Australian town of Dubbo[?] in April 1993, shaking things up up a bit but causing no harm.\nOn the dark morning hours of January 18, 2000, a fireball exploded over the town of White Horse[?] in the Canadian Yukon at an altitude of about 26 kilometers, lighting up the night like day and bringing down a third of of the Yukon's electrical power grid, due to the \"electromagnetic pulse\" created by the blast. The meteor that produced the fireball was estimated to be about 4.6 meters in diameter and with a weight of 180 tonnes.\nA particularly interesting fireball was observed moving north over the Rocky Mountains from the US Southwest to Canada on August 10 1972, and was filmed by a tourist at the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming with an 8-millimeter color movie camera. The object was in the range of size from a car to a house and should have ended its life in a Hiroshima-sized blast, but there was never any explosion, much less a crater. Analysis of the trajectory indicated that it never came much lower than 58 kilometers of the ground, and the conclusion was that it had grazed Earth's atmosphere for about 100 seconds, then skipped back out of the atmosphere to return to its orbit around the Sun.\nMany impact events occur without being observed by anyone on the ground. Between 1975 and 1992, American missile early warning satellites picked up 136 major explosions in the upper atmosphere.\nThe Tunguska event was about a thousand times more powerful than such events. Shoemaker estimated that one of such magnitude occurs about once every 300 years. This is not a long interval even by historical standards, and it is a somewhat nerve-wracking question to consider when the next \"Big One\" will be, and more to the point, where.\nSee also the giant impact theory of the formation of the Moon, possibly describing the largest impact Earth has ever suffered.\nExternal links\nEarth impacts (http://www.vectorsite.net/taimpact)\nEarth Impact Database (http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/index)\nFurther Reading\nSmit J., Hertogen J.

These documents were originally edited on the wiki at freedomdefined.org, which you can visit to see endorsements of the definition and to add your own.\nOpen Source Hardware (OSHW) Statement of Principles 1.0\nOpen source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design. The hardware\u2019s source, the design from which it is made, is available in the preferred format for making modifications to it. Ideally, open source hardware uses readily-available components and materials, standard processes, open infrastructure, unrestricted content, and open-source design tools to maximize the ability of individuals to make and use hardware. Open source hardware gives people the freedom to control their technology while sharing knowledge and encouraging commerce through the open exchange of designs.\nOpen Source Hardware (OSHW) Definition 1.0\nThe Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Definition 1.0 is based on the Open Source Definition for Open Source Software. That definition was created by Bruce Perens and the Debian developers as the Debian Free Software Guidelines.\nIntroduction\nOpen Source Hardware (OSHW) is a term for tangible artifacts \u2014 machines, devices, or other physical things \u2014 whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can make, modify, distribute, and use those things. This definition is intended to help provide guidelines for the development and evaluation of licenses for Open Source Hardware.\nHardware is different from software in that physical resources must always be committed for the creation of physical goods. Accordingly, persons or companies producing items (\u201cproducts\u201d) under an OSHW license have an obligation to make it clear that such products are not manufactured, sold, warrantied, or otherwise sanctioned by the original designer and also not to make use of any trademarks owned by the original designer.\nThe distribution terms of Open Source Hardware must comply with the following criteria:\n1. Documentation\nThe hardware must be released with documentation including design files, and must allow modification and distribution of the design files. Where documentation is not furnished with the physical product, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining this documentation for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The documentation must include design files in the preferred format for making changes, for example the native file format of a CAD program. Deliberately obfuscated design files are not allowed. Intermediate forms analogous to compiled computer code \u2014 such as printer-ready copper artwork from a CAD program \u2014 are not allowed as substitutes. The license may require that the design files are provided in fully-documented, open format(s).\n2. Scope\nThe documentation for the hardware must clearly specify what portion of the design, if not all, is being released under the license.\n3. Necessary Software\nIf the licensed design requires software, embedded or otherwise, to operate properly and fulfill its essential functions, then the license may require that one of the following conditions are met:\na) The interfaces are sufficiently documented such that it could reasonably be considered straightforward to write open source software that allows the device to operate properly and fulfill its essential functions. For example, this may include the use of detailed signal timing diagrams or pseudocode to clearly illustrate the interface in operation.\nb) The necessary software is released under an OSI-approved open source license.\n4. Derived Works\nThe license shall allow modifications and derived works, and shall allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original work. The license shall allow for the manufacture, sale, distribution, and use of products created from the design files, the design files themselves, and derivatives thereof.\n5. Free redistribution\nThe license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the project documentation. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale. The license shall not require any royalty or fee related to the sale of derived works.\n6. Attribution\nThe license may require derived documents, and copyright notices associated with devices, to provide attribution to the licensors when distributing design files, manufactured products, and/or derivatives thereof. The license may require that this information be accessible to the end-user using the device normally, but shall not specify a specific format of display. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original design.\n7. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups\nThe license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.\n8. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor\nThe license must not restrict anyone from making use of the work (including manufactured hardware) in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it must not restrict the hardware from being used in a business, or from being used in nuclear research.\n9. Distribution of License\nThe rights granted by the license must apply to all to whom the work is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.\n10. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product\nThe rights granted by the license must not depend on the licensed work being part of a particular product. If a portion is extracted from a work and used or distributed within the terms of the license, all parties to whom that work is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted for the original work.\n11. License Must Not Restrict Other Hardware or Software\nThe license must not place restrictions on other items that are aggregated with the licensed work but not derivative of it. For example, the license must not insist that all other hardware sold with the licensed item be open source, nor that only open source software be used external to the device.\n12. License Must Be Technology-Neutral\nNo provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology, specific part or component, material, or style of interface or use thereof.\nAfterword\nThe signatories of this Open Source Hardware definition recognize that the open source movement represents only one way of sharing information. We encourage and support all forms of openness and collaboration, whether or not they fit this definition.\nLinks\nWevolver article - https://hardwarenews.wevolver.com/what-is-the-source-of-open-source-hardware/\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/index.php?title=Open_Source_Hardware_Association_Open_Source_Hardware_Definition&oldid=162285\"\nNavigation menu\nPersonal tools\nLog inRequest account\nNamespaces\nPage\nDiscussion\nVariants\nViews\nRead\nView source\nView history\nMore\nSearch\nNavigation\nMain pageWebsiteSite MapWiki InstructionsRecent Wiki ChangesBlog\nOpen Source Ecology\nAbout OSESupport OSEContact UsMailing ListIn The NewsEventsDiscussion ForumsFAQ\nTools\nWhat links hereRelated changesSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage information\nThis page was last edited on 8 December 2017, at 21:35.\nContent is available under CreativeCommons by-sa4.0 unless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout Open Source Ecology\nDisclaimers"

money boosted by 14%\n$2.7 million for winners\n$36,235 for first-round losers\nEvent hit by match-fixing allegations\nCNN\n\u2014\nAfter being rocked by allegations of match-fixing earlier this year, the Australian Open will have a record $36 million prize pot as it tries to combat corruption at the lower rungs of the sport.\nAlthough the men\u2019s and women\u2019s singles champions can look forward to a cool A$3.7 million ($2.7 million) paycheck, or 9% more than last year, the biggest gains were reserved for the sport\u2019s lower-ranked players.\nThose competing in the qualifying event at the 2017 Australian Open in January will get a pay increase of 39%, while reaching the first three rounds of the main singles draw will be rewarded with a rise of as much as 30%.\n\u201cWe are committed to further improving the pay and conditions on the international tennis tour to ensure every professional tennis player is properly compensated,\u201d tournament director and chief executive Craig Tiley said in an emailed statement.\nThe Australian Open now has the second-highest prize purse in tennis behind the US Open, which in 2016 paid out $46.3 million.\nRead: Djokovic will rebound

Angelique Kerber and Novak Djokovic are being paid millions of dollars in prize money and endorsements, tennis is a notoriously hard sport for those battling for ranking points and prize money on the lower-tier circuits.\nLess than half of almost 14,000 professional tennis players make no prize money at all while the annual average cost of playing on the men\u2019s and women\u2019s circuits is around $40,000, according to the International Tennis Federation.\nAngelique Kerber at Melbourne Park in January.\nScott Barbour/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\nWith such high costs and low pay, it is thought lower-ranked players are more vulnerable to match-fixing such as throwing a match or losing a set.\nREAD: Just how much does it cost to produce a tennis player?\nMatch-fixing allegations\nThe Australian Open, which starts on January 16 at Melbourne Park, came under scrutiny in January of this year after a joint investigation by Buzzfeed and the BBC published on the first day of the tournament alleged match-fixing was a widespread problem in tennis and had been ignored by officials.\nKerber has done it!! #AusOpen https://t.co/uLE08xWLnu\u2014 #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 30, 2016\nAlthough the investigation did not show any actual evidence of match fixing and tennis authorities strongly rejected any suggestion that evidence of match fixing was suppressed or not thoroughly investigated by the Tennis Integrity Unit, the sport\u2019s four governing bodies announced the creation of an independent three-man review panel 10 days later.\nThey said at the time the investigation would take at least one year.\nREAD: Investigators think tennis officials ignored evidence of match fixing, report says\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our brand was damaged, but I certainly think there was some damage to the sport,\u201d Steve Healy, president of Tennis Australia, told CNN by phone from Sydney.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that the panel will find that there is no entrenched corruption in the sport,\u201d said Healy.\n\u201cBut I am sure they\u2019ll find certain things than can be done better and we will implement those and fund them to the full extent if necessary to protect the sport.\u201d\nIntegrity measures\nEarlier this week, Healy announced a host of measures aimed at strengthening the integrity of the season\u2019s first grand slam event, including the creation of a National Integrity Unit headed up by former law enforcement officer and long-time sports management and policy expert Ann West.\nThe unit also hired two full-time experienced investigators from law enforcement backgrounds, an information and intelligence officer and a safety and risk manager.\nAustralian Open prize money:\nMen\u2019s and women\u2019s main draw singles:- Winner\n$2.7 million (+9%)- Runner-up\n$1,4 million (+9%)- Semifinals\n$596,222 (+9%)- Quarterfinals $298,111(+9%)- Round 4\n$159,962 (+14%)- Round 3\n$94,523(+20%)- Round 2\n$58,168 (+19%)-

This includes increasing prize money as well as removing as many costs as possible associated with playing our events.\nVisit cnn.com/tennis for more news and videos\n\u201cOur aim is to shift the break-even point for professional players, to ensure that tennis is a viable career option for the best male and female athletes in the world.

For the producers in charge of two-time-Emmy-winning reality series, The Amazing Race, it's a logistical nightmare of the highest order. Moving people and equipment around the world for a month requires precise planning and a small army of people to pull it off.\n\"We have over 2,000 pe\u00adople working on the show worldwide,\" says producer/creator Bertram van Munster, who starts planning out each Race edition three months ahead of time. \"In order to lay out the Race and make it financially, creatively and logistically work, I go everywhere and lay it out, and hand all that knowledge over to the rest of my team,\" he says. \"Then I travel with my team again around the world and plan exactly where the camera position is going to go, what we're going to do, and come up with all the challenges.\"\nAdvertisement\nContents\nPlanning and More Planning\nGoing Local\nKeeping Things Safe\nA Road-weary Host\nPlanning and More Planning\n\"\"\nTeammates Susan and Patrick and Gretchen and Meredith navigate their way through the airport in Arequipa, Peru\nPhoto courtesy\nNot surprisingly, van Munster knows quite a lot about getting from one place to the next. \"People in my office are sometimes shocked by the amount of airline schedules I have in my head. I can tell you where Air Nepal is flying at 1:00 in the afternoon. I can tell you how many flights Air Botswana has between Gabarone and Johannesburg,\" says the Dutch-born producer, though unforeseen travel roadblocks inevitably arise.\n\"Every time we get on a plane and we go to an airport, it's like rolling the dice,\" says Race host Phil Keoghan. \"Is there going to be a mechanical [problem] on the plane? Are there going to be weather delays? We've been sitting on planes with the weather closing in and a team might be on another plane that got out before the weather closed in. Now we're sitting on the ground and we know the teams are racing ahead of us. It gets really challenging. I've literally Raced teams to the pit stop. One time I was literally running up to the mat while they were running from the other direction.\"\nAdvertisement\nThen there's the totally unforeseen obstacle that can force the production to change locations. \"In Argentina, about two years ago, we had a situation where the entire banking system collapsed. I was about to wire a substantial amount of money there because we were going to shoot there. We changed the itinerary from Brazil-Argentina-South Africa to Brazil-London-South Africa,\" remembers van Munster. \"We had a situation in Rio where the paparazzi found out where we were going to be shooting and we switched samba bars.\"\nGoing Local\n\"\"\nMegan and Heidi perform a Detour in Huambutio, Peru.\nPhoto courtesy\nWith the popularity of Race, it's now necessary to have security, decoys and cover stories to fool the curious, particularly in places American tourists frequent. \"We have the Pied Piper motif going on a little bit,\" allows van Munster. \"We'll call the show something else-they think we're filming a commercial,\" adds co-producer Elise Doganieri, van Munster's wife. \"We'll be setting up a club box and Americans will ask, 'Is this The Amazing Race?' And we'll say, 'No, we're doing a documentary.'\"\nDoganieri and van Munster employ a network of local facilitators in each location Race visits. \"I set up a worldwide infrastructure years ago to produce a different show and I have satellite offices around the world that we've used through the years. These are people I know for many years and through these offices we get our permits,\" says van Munster. Adds Doganieri, \"We tell them 'We need this many cars at this location,' 'We need this many hotel rooms,' and we negotiate the deal when we get there.\"\nAdvertisement\nAs you might expect, their phone bills are astronomical. Typically, \"one country alone was over $25,000,\" notes van Munster, who calls communications their biggest logistical challenge. Satellite cell phones \"keep us aware of everybody and where they are,\" he says. \"Each team has a crew and so does Phil,\" adds Doganieri. \"Everybody has a cell phone so they can stay in contact.\"\nAs for the challenges they create for the teams, van Munster and Doganieri strive to make them indigenous to the location. \"You have to find things that the locals do, and you don't look in a tourist guidebook,\" says Doganieri. \"You drive around the countryside and you look for the little things, because the locals sometimes don't even realize how unique the things they do are, like building a mud hut.\"\n\"\"\nA Roadblock Challenge in Mendoza, Argentina required one team member to consume 4 lbs of a traditional Argentinean barbeque.\nPhoto courtesy\nAdvertisement\nKeeping Things Safe\n\"\"\nLynn Warren, an executive assistant from West Hollywood, Calif., travels over a gorge in Huambutio, Peru\nPhoto courtesy\nThe challenges must also be difficult, exciting to watch and safe. \"Absolutely everything is totally checked over and over and over again. We can't afford to put these people at risk,\" assures Keoghan. \"It's perceived danger. To me what really works about the Race is not when we put people in harm's way. It's when they're pushed outside their comfort zone. Watching ordinary people in a totally unusual, extreme situation is interesting TV.\"\nDoganieri is among the challenge testers, and vividly recalls a 134-meter bungee jump she made in New Zealand a few seasons back. \"I'd never done that and I'm a little afraid of heights. I took about four minutes before I stepped off. I knew if I was that scared we had to do it for the show. But I almost had a heart attack doing that one,\" she admits.\nAdvertisement\nIn the event of a real medical emergency, contingency plans are in place. \"We have first aid, and we know all the hospitals and have doctors on call. We have ambulances standing by,\" says van Munster. There have been a few mishaps. A rescue boat in Vietnam hit a sandbar, injuring a producer, and another producer broke her wrist. Several contestants have been hurt, though not seriously.\nA Road-weary Host\n\"\"\nPhil Keoghan, host of The Amazing Race\nPhoto courtesy\nThe current edition of The Amazing Race, its seventh, began in Long Beach, California with 11 teams, including engaged Survivor: All Stars winner and runner-up, Amber Brkich and Rob Mariano. Keoghan greets the teams as they arrive at the pit stop for each leg of the Race for a 12-hour rest. \"They really do stink. And they always want to hug me,\" laughs the New Zealander, who adopts a stony demeanor for a second or two before he tells them they're still in the Race. \"I want the tension there on the mat,\" he explains. \"The feedback that I've gotten from the audience is that they love not knowing, and they love that I mess with them a little.\"\nHe interviews the contestants after they arrive, and those sound bites are used throughout the show. \"When they come in, they're excited and pumped up and want to share their experiences. I get a front row seat to this amazing game,\" says Keoghan, for whom the hardest part of the job is telling the last team they have to go home. Once eliminated, teams must board the next plane to the U.S.\nAdvertisement\nKeoghan, who produces and hosts No Opportunity Wasted for TLC and wrote a book of the same name last year in addition to his Race duties, had two days off in 2004. \"I was so fried when I got home. But on the day when I didn't have anything to do, I didn't quite know what to do with myself. I couldn't actually believe that I had a day off. I added it up and I think I did something like 450,000 miles last year. I was speaking to a pilot who flies for Virgin about it and he said, 'Dude, you flew more than I did. I fly four times a month.' It was insane. I would wake up and go, 'OK, where am I? What country am I in?'\"\nHe's not confused, however, about the appeal of this show and what sets it apart from its reality brethren. \"A huge part of it is that we're always in unique places and can show you something you've never seen before,\" says Keoghan. \"One of the things that makes Race stand out is that we have consistently had a show that has accentuated the positive, always gone for something uplifting that is a celebration of the human spirit, rather than a train-wreck show. The show is not about going to extremes to create television.\"\n\"\"\nThe cast of THE AMAZING RACE 7\nPhoto courtesy\nNevertheless, the producers like to change things up from time to time, adding new elements to the game. Season eight will feature teams of four players instead of two, all with some familial connection.\nAdvertisement\n\u200b\nCite This!\nPlease copy/paste the following text to properly cite this HowStuffWorks.com article:\nCopy\nGerri Miller\n\"Inside The Amazing Race\"\n7 April 2005.HowStuffWorks.com. <https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/amazing-race.htm>\n20 December 2022\nClose\nCitation\nFeatured\nSpecial Offer on Antivirus Software From HowStuffWorks and TotalAV Security\nTry Our Crossword Puzzles!\nCan You Solve This Riddle?\nMore Awesome Stuff\n\"\"\nUp Next\nHow Reality TV Works\nExplore More\n\"\"\nYou May Like\nHow 'Fight Quest' Works\nExplore More\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nLoading...\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement"

It can cost independent filmmakers $10,000 to clear the song for their films, and this is a major stumbling block hindering the creation of new works of art. The 1987 PBS Civil Rights documentary, Eyes on the Prize is but one notable example.While this has made for many inspiring creative alternatives in film and restaurant chains alike, we felt it was time to dethrone that old ditty and create a new national repository of alternate Birthday song compositions.

We hope it\u2019s great!\u201dWriting tip: One Hallmark writer said she chooses her cards very carefully for each birthday person so that she doesn\u2019t have to add much in the way of a personal message. In other words, it\u2019s fine to let the printed message and design do most of the talking for you. Even professional writers do it!Especially for close friends or family members, you might want to make a wish, not just for a happy day, but for a happy, successful next-year-of-their-life. You can keep your wish general, or include specific things the birthday person loves to do or goals he or she hopes to achieve.More general examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHere\u2019s to another year of living your dreams. Cheers!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHere\u2019s wishing you another stupendous year on this planet.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou deserve everything happy.

Every single thing you want.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCouldn\u2019t resist this little puppy. I hope you feel the way he looks all day long. Just tail-waggingly ecstatic to be alive in the big, beautiful world. That\u2019s the whole kind of year I wish you.\u201d *More specific examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHappy [41st]! May this be the year you finally take that fishing trip to Canada! Make it happen!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWishing you a happy birthday and another strong, healthy year! You already look amazing. I\u2019ll be cheering you on as you keep working toward your goal.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGo forth from this birthday and prosper in your [ukulele playing]!\u201dWriting tip: If you often have a hard time deciding what to write, then choose a card with a fun photo or design you can comment on or a printed message that leads you naturally into your own personal message. *As an example, this personal message refers to a photo of a puppy on the card\u2019s cover.A birthday is the perfect occasion to tell people they\u2019re great, and a birthday card is an ideal vehicle for delivering admiring words. You can be more expressive in a card than in conversation\u2014without distressing a birthday person who may be easily embarrassed by face-to-face compliments.Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnother year older, and you just keep getting stronger, wiser, funnier and more amazing all around!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHere\u2019s to another year of wonderful you.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re one tough cookie. Celebrating you!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCelebrating another wild and wonderful year of you.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou should be getting paid for how good you look. Seriously.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou could run circles around most people half your age, but you\u2019re way too nice to show them up like that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t think about anything today but having a good time\u2014and of course, soaking up the compliments that will be coming from everybody. You deserve them!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEvery time I get down about the world, I remember there are people like you, going around being good in the world and counteracting the dark forces. You should be on a sci-fi show or something, being the super-powered opposite of evil. Happy Birthday and long may you shine!\u201dWriting tip: One Hallmark writer said he likes to imagine he\u2019s toasting the birthday person when he\u2019s signing the card. Consider lifting your imaginary glass to see what warm compliments and big wishes come to mind!Birthdays are for reminding the important people in our lives that we love them and are super-grateful that, on this day years ago, they were born. This will probably come naturally when it\u2019s your mom or your significant other celebrating a birthday. But even if it\u2019s the brother you normally punch in the arm to let him know you love him, make his birthday the one day a year when you put it in writing.Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHappy Birthday to one of my favorite people in the history of ever.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThanks for being here, for being you.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re on this earth.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope you feel loved and appreciated today. Because you are.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThanks for being wonderful. Thanks for being you.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith love that will never stop growing,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLove you oodles and oodles.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith warmest wishes and love on your birthday and always,\u201dWriting tip: One Hallmark writer has adopted her mother\u2019s custom of signing her cards to her children and grandchildren with \u201cOceans of love,\u201d. Consider creating a signature closing that you always use in cards to your special people.The birthday person should live a little on their day, right? You can use your personal message to encourage them to let their hair down\u2014or to let them know you look forward to letting your hair down alongside them!Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo happy to be celebrating your [28th] with you!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWoot! Woot! Thanks for giving me an excuse to eat cake and drink martinis!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo any damn thing you want to today!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Can\u2019t wait to celebrate with you and \u2018Rita\u2019! (Salt or no salt for you?)\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGo a little wild on your birthday! You have my blessing.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHere\u2019s to you on your birthday, [Alex]! I hope you\u2019re doing it up big!\u201dWriting tip: Are you the artistic type? Even if the best you can do is a stick person in a party hat, an original drawing somewhere in the signature space can add a fun, personal touch to your birthday wish.If you\u2019re a little (or a lot) older than the birthday person and care to share what you\u2019ve learned through the years, then, by all means, let the wisdom pour forth from your pen!Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe you\u2019re turning [20]! Be smart, be safe, have fun, take pictures, and enjoy every minute of this exciting time in your life!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust remember birthdays aren\u2019t about numbers. Birthdays are about our chance to celebrate you and tell you how much we love you! Have a great one!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope you enjoy being [40]! That was a while ago for me, but I do remember this: It was great\u2026and it just kept getting better from there. On your birthday, that\u2019s what I\u2019m wishing for you, too.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTime to celebrate! We can still dance the night away at our age\u2014we just need to invest in some gel insoles first.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWishing you a happy birthday and a year of being good to yourself, embracing life\u2019s joys and realizing that the best is truly yet to come!\u201dWriting tip: You could also share your wisdom in list form: \u201cFive things I\u2019ve learned about growing older\u2026\u201dBirthdays and laughter go together like frosting and sprinkles! If you know the birthday person pretty well, then inside jokes, lighthearted wishes and good-natured teasing are all fair game.Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI think you\u2019re officially vintage now!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWelcome to the age of ear hair!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHappy act-your-shoe-size day!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHappy Birthday to a [brother] who always keeps me laughing (about 99% WITH you and 1% AT you).\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRemember: Middle-age memory = No regrets.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cParty \u2019til you\u2019re pooped! (At our age, it shouldn\u2019t take long.)\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope your birthday spanking is delivered by a combination of [Matt Damon, George Clooney and Brad Pitt]. If you\u2019re not into spanking, forget I said anything. Just have a very happy birthday!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA wise poet once said, \u2018What is time? All is meaningless, especially how many candles on thy cake. Age and numbers can biteth me!\u2019 OK, maybe that was me instead of a wise poet.\u201dWriting tip: You have to know people pretty well to poke fun at them in a card. If you\u2019re not sure, then stick with more general humor that makes light of something other than the birthday person\u2019s age, personality or appearance.If your faith is a natural part of the way you look at life and relationships, then write from the heart and let it show in the way you sign a birthday card.Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGod bless you on your birthday.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo grateful that God put you on this earth and in my life.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWishing you a happy birthday and a year that\u2019s blessed.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHappy Birthday to a [son] who is such a blessing to us every day.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLifting you up in prayer on your birthday. Asking God to give you a sweet day and a year filled with joy.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not that good of a Christian, but when I see someone like you, providing a living example, it really helps. I think God wanted me to get to know someone like you, so I could see how it\u2019s done day by day. You are such an inspiration to me. Thanks for being my friend.\u201dWriting tip: Unless you have reason to believe the recipient would be offended, there\u2019s no need to shy away from mentioning God, prayers or blessings in what you write.Show the birthday person how well you know them by sharing a highlight from the past year of their life\u2026or a story from way back when.Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere are a lot of highlights from your year of being [33], but if I had to choose just one, it would definitely be [your one-handed cartwheel when you spoke at chapel]! So awesome! Wishing you many more moments like that as a [strong, acrobatic woman of 34]!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWow! So much has happened for you since your last birthday. You [moved to a great new house, finished your M.B.A. and became a dad to the world\u2019s most adorable baby]. You\u2019re officially on a roll, birthday [boy]! Hope the next year of your life is just as eventful and happy!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRemember how over the moon you were on your [6th] birthday when [Dad wheeled in your new blue bike]? I hope this birthday finds you smiling just as big.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m thinking about your last birthday. I seriously recommend celebrating any way but THAT!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHope your birthday is as fun as those middle-school slumber parties back in the day! Minus [Kristi Sears\u2019 screaming]. Plus [wine].\u201dWriting tip: When sharing a memory, you can open up a conversation by asking if the birthday person remembers the story or event quite like you do. It can be fun to discover details you, or they, weren\u2019t even aware of.If you have some favorite words about living well or growing older, why not quote them when you sign a birthday card? The quote doesn\u2019t have to relate specifically to birthdays or aging. Anything you think would be fun, inspiring or meaningful for the birthday person is a good bet!Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2018I celebrate myself and sing myself\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 Walt Whitman\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s your birthday\u2014party like Walt would!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2018I am not young but I feel young. The day I feel old, I will go to bed and stay there. J\u2019aime la vie! I feel that to live is a wonderful thing.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 Coco Chanel\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stay young at heart! Happy Birthday!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2018Grow old along with me! The best is yet to be\u2026\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 Robert Browning\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How I love growing older with you.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2018You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream\u2026\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 C.S. Lewis\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From one dreamer to another, Happy Birthday!\u201dWriting tip: You can draw quotations from favorite books, poetry, songs, movie dialogue and more.

So, it\u2019s your job to let him or her know what a big deal it is to have a nice, round-number birthday!Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c[50] never looked so great!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHappy Birthday, [Jared]! Now that you\u2019ve arrived here, [40] will never be the same again!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTurning [60] is big! Especially when it\u2019s someone like you, who has made the most of each year and made such a positive difference for the people in your life.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c[30] is quite possibly the perfect age. You\u2019re old enough to afford the good shoes and still young enough to kick up your heels!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHappy [90th] Birthday, [Nana Betty]! Today, we\u2019re celebrating the amazing [woman] you are, honoring the life you\u2019ve lived and, just like always, loving you so much!\u201dWriting tip: Ages 16, 18, 21, 30, 40, 50, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 and 100 are traditionally considered milestones. Cards specific to these birthdays will feature the age number prominently in their design, but you can make any card a milestone card (or any birthday a milestone birthday) by writing that shiny new age number somewhere in your personal message.Late really is better than never! If life, memory lapse or alien abduction has interfered with the timely delivery of your card, send it anyway. You can include a sincere or humorous apology\u2026or just frame it as your way of extending the birthday fun!Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo sorry these birthday wishes are late reaching you. I hope it was happy!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHappy Birthday\u2026a little late!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re receiving this NOW and not on your ACTUAL birthday, because I am extremely thoughtful and wanted to be sure the celebration of YOU was not limited to just one day. That is so nice of me, right? Well, you are worth it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt least my Happy Birthday text was on time. That counts for something, right? \u263a Happy Belated Birthday!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know where my head was but I forgot your birthday! Until now! I\u2019m glad I finally remembered because it gives me a chance to say how great I think you are (and stand out from the vast crowd who said it on the right day!). You\u2019re amazing and awesome, and I hope you have a great ALL YEAR.\u201dWriting tip: Cards made specifically for belated birthdays are good for when you remember the birthday after the fact. However, if you already have the card but just didn\u2019t get it delivered on time, stick with what you\u2019ve got. You can mention its lateness in your personal message\u2014or not. It\u2019s really your call.Birthdays are happy occasions that sometimes fall during tough times due to illness, job loss, bereavement or other challenging circumstances. Here are some ideas for letting the birthday person know you\u2019re still thinking of them and celebrating them even in the midst of a difficult year.Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know you\u2019ve had some real challenges this year, and it has been great to see how well you have met them.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a year. You made it! Let\u2019s celebrate THAT!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLife owes you some really good times. Hope they start right now.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve had more than your share of challenges this year\u2014hope this will feel like a brand-new year of better days.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope this next year is gentle and sweet to you and gives you lots of reasons to smile and lots of time to rest.\u201dWriting tip: Humor can be a great day-brightener even in the midst of a hard time. If you know the birthday person appreciates a good laugh, feel free to choose a funny card and/or add a humorous personal messageChances are, your family members will be getting a lot of birthday cards from you through the years, so you can mix it up and write a longer personal message some years and a shorter message others. Love, compliments and warm wishes all work nicely for family. So do \u201cProud of you\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re family\u201d messages.Examples\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHappy Birthday, [Mom]. We love you so much!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEvery year, I\u2019m even more grateful to have a [brother] like you.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe still remember the first time we laid eyes on you\u2014on this day [23] years ago. You were so beautiful right from the start, and with every year, you grow even more beautiful. Hope you know how much we love you and how grateful we are to call you our [daughter].\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo proud of the person you are! So happy we\u2019re family.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo my hero\u2026my dad!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am just so in awe and so proud of the person you are\u2026and so proud to call you my [sister].\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, [Grandpa], another year has gone by, and I still haven\u2019t come across anyone wiser, kinder, more generous or better at [checkers] than you. You\u2019re the best\u2014always!\u201d\nHappy Birthday Card Messages Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nHappy Birthday Card Messages Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nHappy Birthday Card Messages Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nHappy Birthday Card Messages Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nHappy Birthday Card Messages Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nHappy Birthday Card Messages Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nHappy Birthday Card Messages Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nHappy Birthday Card Messages Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nHappy Birthday Card Messages Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nHappy Birthday Card Messages Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nHappy Birthday Card Messages Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nPosted by\nUnknown\nat\n22:27\nNo comments:\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\nLabels:\nHappy Birthday Card Messages\nHappy Birthday Stevie Wonder Happy Birthday Cake Quotes Pictures Meme Sister Funny Brother Mom to you to me Pictures\nHappy Birthday Stevie Wonder Biography\nSource link(Google.com.pk)\n\"Happy Birthday\" is a 1981 single written, produced, and performed by Stevie Wonder for the Motown label. Wonder, a social activist, was one of the main figures in the campaign to have the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. become a national holiday, and created this single to make the cause known. Besides being released as a single, the song also appears on Wonder's album Hotter Than July.The song, one of many of Wonder's songs to feature the use of a keyboard synthesizer, features Wonder lamenting the fact that anyone would oppose the idea of a Dr. King holiday, where \"peace is celebrated throughout the world\" and singing to King in the chorus, \"Happy birthday to you\". The holiday, he proposes, would facilitate the realization of Dr. King's dreams of integration and \"love and unity for all of God's children\".Wonder used the song to popularize the campaign, and continued his fight for the holiday, holding the Rally for Peace Press Conference in 1981. United States President Ronald Reagan approved the creation of the holiday, signing it into existence on November 2, 1983. The first official Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, held the third Monday in January of each year, was held on January 20, 1986, and was commemorated with a large-scale concert, where Stevie Wonder was the headlining performer.Although the single failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100, it charted on the R&B chart, and it became one of Wonder's biggest hits in the UK, reaching No.2 in the charts in August 1981.Wonder also performed this song at the Diamond Jubilee Concert in London for the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.\u00a0\"Happy Birthday\" is track #10 on the album Hotter Than July. It was written by Wonder, Stevie.You know it doesn't make much senseThere ought to be a law againstAnyone who takes offenseAt a day in your celebration'Cause we all know in our mindsThat there ought to be a timeThat we can set asideTo show just how much we love youAnd I'm sure you would agreeIt couldn't fit more perfectlyThan to have a world partyOn the day you came to beHappy birthday to youHappy birthday to youHappy birthdayHappy birthday to youHappy birthday to youHappy birthdayI just never understoodHow a man who died for goodCould not have a day that wouldBe set aside for his recognition'Cause it should never beJust 'cause some cannot seeThe dream as clear as heThat they should make it become an illusionAnd we all know everythingThat he stood for time will bringFor in peace our hearts will singThanks to Martin Luther KingHappy birthday to youHappy birthday to youHappy birthdayHappy birthday to youHappy birthday to youHappy birthdayWhy has there never been a holiday, yeahWhere peace is celebratedAll throughout the worldThe time is overdueFor people like me and youWho know the way to truthIs love and unity to all God's childrenIt should never be a great eventAnd the whole day should be spentIn full remembranceOf those who lived and died for the oneness of all peopleSo let us all beginWe know that love can winLet it out don't hold it inSing it loud as

(I don't have access to the server. I'm just a user with CPanel)\n\u2013\u00a0Hamid\nSep 26, 2012 at 7:46\nSee @RedGrittyBrick's answer below. Essentially unless you want to configure your webserver for sub-domains you would need DNS entries on the DNS Server for each.\n\u2013\u00a0HaydnWVN\nSep 26, 2012 at 9:12\nAdd a comment\n|\n2 Answers\n2\nSorted by:\nReset to default\nHighest score (default)\nDate modified (newest first)\nDate created (oldest first)\n1\nWhen a webserver like Apache receives a HTTP request for a web-site domain that it isn't configured for, it will return the contents for the first website that is in it's configuration.\n(or a 404 response if the part of the URL after the hostname doesn't exist in the default site)\nSo probably the webserver isn't correctly configured.\nConfiguring domains in DNS is a separate action from configuring sites (with domain-names) in a web-server. Details depend on your hosting service.\nUpdate:\nDNS\nHere's an example DNS zone file\nwww.example.com\nIN\nA\n203.0.113.5\nwww.example.org\nIN\nA\n203.0.113.5\nYour domain hosting provider will have a point and click GUI for you to add these records, you don't have to do it using a text editor. However exactly what the GUI tools look like, and how to use them, depend on exactly which domain hosting service you are using.\nIn the case of the problem you describe, these records are probably set up correctly, you want to host both example.com and example.org on the same server.\nHTTPD\nHere's an example configuration for Apache HTTPD\n# Ensure that Apache listens on port 80\nListen 80\n# Listen for virtual host requests on all IP addresses\nNameVirtualHost *:80\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nDocumentRoot /www/example1\nServerName www.example.com\n# Other directives here\n</VirtualHost>\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nDocumentRoot /www/example2\nServerName www.example.org\n# Other directives here\n</VirtualHost>\nIf the second <VirtualHost> clause (for example.org) was omitted, Apache would serve up the page for example.com if you asked it for example.org. (actually it's been a while since I tested this but I expect it is still so).\nYour hosting company's Control-Panel will have a point and click GUI that will cause the appropriate sections to be added to the HTTPD configuration file for you (you don't have to edit this textual configuration file using a text editor).\nIf your web-hosting company uses Nginx or IIS instead of Apache HTTPD, the config file may look completely different. The design and operation of the configuration GUI depends on your exact hosting provider, there are too many variations to cover them all here.\nI believe aftab.cc is hosted by your-server.de who use Apache HTTPD and cPanel, If you google for \"How to add a site to a cPanel hosting plan\" you should find some useful videos and other tutorial material. Good luck.\nShare\nImprove this answer\nFollow\nedited Sep 26, 2012 at 10:27\nanswered Sep 26, 2012 at 7:50\nRedGrittyBrickRedGrittyBrick\n80.3k1919 gold badges132132 silver badges199199 bronze badges\n2\nThanks, but how can they solve the problem?

As I originally said, what you do depends on exactly which control-panel and httpd software your hosting service uses. They vary a lot, I can't cover all of them.\n\u2013\u00a0RedGrittyBrick\nSep 26, 2012 at 10:01\nAdd a comment\n|\n0\nFinally the problem was discovered!!\nYou may not believe but it seems that it is a bug in CPanel, when you transfer a website to a new server, sometimes all subdomains are added as a Parked Domain!!!!\nYou have to go to Parked domain and remove all of them and if it is needed you should remove all subdomains and create them again!!\nI just remembered when we transferred our website about 7 years ago, I faced to this problem but I couldn't understand how our hosting solved the problem! but now they told me the problem...\nAnyway, I hope this topic would be useful for future and I hope CPanel team review their codes and cover the bug!\nThanks for your help ;)\nShare\nImprove this answer\nFollow\nanswered Sep 26, 2012 at 16:27\nHamidHamid\n111 silver badge11 bronze badge\nAdd a comment\n|\nNot the answer you're looking for?

Given a graph G and two distinct nodes S and E, is there a Hamiltonian path in G from S to E?\nI've found that this problem is NP-Complete\nShortest Path\nIn graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.\nThis problem is P\nWhat is the actual difference between them?

It is easy to see that the two problems are basically equivalent (longest simple path and hamiltonian path). This problem is indeed a classic NP-Complete Problem.\nIt is NP-Complete since there is a polynomial reduction from another (already proved) NP-Hard Problem to this problem, and thus (from transitivity of polynomial reductions) this problem is NP-Hard as well. Since it is also in NP, it is NP-Complete.\nThe shortest path on the other hand is a different one, it asks what is the shortest way from point A to point B, and it is in P because there is a polynomial time algorithm that solves it (Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford, BFS for non weighted graphs).\nRegarding \"And how is there complexity calculated?\" I assume you mean how do we determine their complexity classes - in this case, Shortest Path is in P because we have a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that solves it (some mentioned above), while the complexity class of Hamiltonian Path is NP-Complete because it is both NP-Hard (there is polynomial reduction from another proven NP-Hard problem), and NP (we can solve it easily in polynomial time on non-determinitic turing machine).\nNote that we DO NOT KNOW if Hamiltonian Path is in P or not, because we do not know if P=NP.\nShare\nImprove this answer\nFollow\nedited Feb 4, 2013 at 15:06\nanswered Feb 4, 2013 at 14:59\namitamit\n174k2727 gold badges228228 silver badges329329 bronze badges\n2\n1\nFirst of all thanks for your answer. Just to make sure that I understood everything, the main difference is:\nHamiltonian Path Problem (or Longest Path Problem): It is important to visit every node in a graph and visit it only once.\nShortest Path Problem: It doesn't restrict how many times we visit a node and doesn't require each node to be visited.\n\u2013\u00a0cgval\nFeb 4, 2013 at 15:10\n2\n@cgval: Exactly, and to be precise, unless there is negative cycle in the graph (and then the term \"shortest path is problematic), each vertex is visited AT MOST once (because otherwise we could shorten the path by trimming a cycle), but it is OK to not visit nodes.\n\u2013\u00a0amit\nFeb 4, 2013 at 15:13\nAdd a comment\n|\n0\nThe difference between the longest path and the shortest path between any nodes is that the shortest path problem has an optimal substructure, and thus it can be solved with dynamic programming; the longest path problem doesn't have an optimal substructure, and it cannot be solved using dynamic programming. A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its sub-problems. example\nan example would be as the above graph. the shortest path from q to t include the shortest path from q to r. However, the longest path from q to t is q-r-t, the longest path from q to r is q-s-t-r, which is not included in the q-r-t. That's because the sub-problems of the longest path is not independent from each other. the longest path from q to r is q-s-r-t. The longest path from r to t is r-q-s-t. These two problem have over-lapping, so they are not independent, so this problem doesn't have optimal-substructure, so that it can not be solved by dynamic programming nor greedy algorithm.\nShare\nImprove this answer\nFollow\nanswered Dec 3, 2019 at 1:55\nsmilingfishsmilingfish\n733 bronze badges\n2\nI forgot to mention that Hamiltonian path can be reduced to longest path problem, if you google 'longest path problem', the wiki page will comes out and it did a good job on explanation.\n\u2013\u00a0smilingfish\nDec 3, 2019 at 1:59\nAnd let's why I compare longest path and shortest path, instead of Hamiltonian path and shortest path.\n\u2013\u00a0smilingfish\nDec 3, 2019 at 2:00\nAdd a comment\n|\nYour Answer\nThanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!Please be sure to answer the question.

So we scanned billions of emails delivered by our system (where campaign tracking was activated, and where users reported their industry) and calculated the average unique open rates, click rates, soft bounces, and hard bounces by industry.\nWe only tracked campaigns that went to at least 1,000 subscribers, but these stats aren\u2019t pulled from a survey of giant corporations with million-dollar marketing budgets and dedicated email marketing teams. Our customers range from 1-person startups, small businesses to Fortune 500 companies, so the whole spectrum is represented in this data. Here\u2019s your apples-to-apples comparison with others in your industry.\nThe data provided on this page was last updated in October 2019 and may vary from benchmarking data provided within the Mailchimp application.\nIndustryAverage Open RateAverage Click RateHard BounceSoft BounceUnsubscribe Rate\nAll non-labeled accounts22.71%2.91%0.40%0.61%0.25%\nAgriculture and Food Services23.31%2.94%0.32%0.50%0.28%\nArchitecture and Construction22.51%2.51%0.73%1.18%0.32%\nArts and Artists26.27%2.95%0.30%0.51%0.28%\nBeauty and Personal Care16.65%1.92%0.26%0.33%0.30%\nBusiness and Finance21.56%2.72%0.43%0.55%0.20%\nComputers and Electronics19.29%2.08%0.47%0.79%0.27%\nConstruction21.77%2.26%0.86%1.28%0.39%\nConsulting20.13%2.49%0.50%0.79%0.27%\nCreative Services/Agency21.39%2.66%0.58%0.93%0.35%\nDaily Deals/E-Coupons15.06%2.23%0.07%0.13%0.10%\nE-Commerce15.68%2.01%0.19%0.26%0.27%\nEducation and Training23.42%2.90%0.32%0.51%0.21%\nEntertainment and Events20.51%2.36%0.28%0.43%0.26%\nGambling21.62%3.30%0.42%0.38%0.15%\nGames21.10%3.66%0.37%0.44%0.25%\nGovernment28.77%3.99%0.33%0.50%0.13%\nHealth and Fitness21.48%2.69%0.30%0.40%0.40%\nHobbies27.74%5.01%0.18%0.31%0.23%\nHome and Garden21.60%3.03%0.32%0.52%0.35%\nInsurance21.36%2.13%0.67%0.71%0.25%\nLegal22.00%2.81%0.52%0.66%0.22%\nManufacturing19.82%2.18%0.72%1.18%0.31%\nMarketing and Advertising17.38%2.04%0.44%0.68%0.27%\nMedia and Publishing22.15%4.62%0.14%0.27%0.12%\nMedical, Dental, and Healthcare21.72%2.49%0.51%0.63%0.28%\nMobile19.29%2.27%0.48%0.58%0.37%\nMusic and Musicians21.88%2.94%0.28%0.48%0.26%\nNon-Profit25.17%2.79%0.33%0.49%0.20%\nPharmaceuticals18.58%2.25%0.39%0.53%0.17%\nPhoto and Video23.24%3.23%0.43%0.65%0.40%\nPolitics22.94%2.37%0.28%0.41%0.21%\nProfessional Services21.94%2.55%0.56%0.83%0.31%\nPublic Relations21.02%1.98%0.45%0.71%0.17%\nReal Estate19.17%1.77%0.38%0.56%0.27%\nRecruitment and Staffing21.14%2.53%0.45%0.53%0.30%\nReligion27.62%3.16%0.17%0.25%0.15%\nRestaurant19.77%1.34%0.37%0.50%0.28%\nRestaurant and Venue20.39%1.40%0.32%0.45%0.39%\nRetail18.39%2.25%0.22%0.32%0.25%\nSocial Networks and Online Communities21.06%3.32%0.20%0.34%0.22%\nSoftware and Web App21.29%2.45%0.65%0.97%0.37%\nSports24.57%3.09%0.26%0.39%0.28%\nTelecommunications20.92%2.27%0.63%0.87%0.23%\nTravel and Transportation20.44%2.25%0.31%0.51%0.24%\nVitamin Supplements15.03%1.62%0.23%0.36%0.27%\nAverage Totals21.33%2.62%0.40%0.58%0.26%\nReady to try what made us famous?\nCreate custom email campaigns, measure performance, and turn insights into results with Mailchimp\u2019s email marketing tools.\nSign up\nThe average email open rate for all industries we analyzed is 21.33%.\nOpen rates are one of the best ways to tell whether your email strategy is working. This number shows what percentage of your audience opens the emails you send them. If you have a higher open rate, it usually means your subject lines resonate with your audience.\nHere are a few examples of successful open rates:\nThe highest open rates are found in government-related emails, with an open rate of 28.77%.\nEmails sent by hobbies entities come in second, with a 27.74% open rate.\nWith a 27.62% open rate, emails about religion came in third.\nThe average open rate for all industries we analyzed is 21.33%.\nHow to improve open rates\nA low open rate generally indicates one of these things:\nYour subject line is not relevant or interesting enough\nYour audience is composed of a wide variety of subscribers\nYou may be sending too many or too few campaigns\nTest your subject line\nThe best way to know what resonates with your subscribers is to try different things in your marketing emails. An effective subject line clearly describes what's inside your campaign, but you'll want to test a few variations to find out what works best for your audience to get higher open rates.\nDraft two or three subject lines that differ slightly, for example, \"Company B Weekly Newsletter\" and \"This Week's News from Company B,\" and set them up in an A/B testing campaign. A/B testing should be a part of your email marketing strategy not only to improve your email marketing statistics but to deliver email users the content they want in a way that is appealing to them.\nTips for subject lines that you should include in your digital marketing strategy\nWriting a good email marketing subject line can be intimidating, especially if you don\u2019t know where to start. Follow these subject line best practices to ensure that you're on the right track when drafting your email marketing campaign.\nPersonalized subject lines\nUse merge tags to personalize your subject lines with each recipient's name or location. Personalized emails are shown to increase open rates for most users, and may work well when combined with marketing automation in transactional emails, such as birthday deals, post-purchase follow-ups or promotional emails.\nBe descriptive\nSometimes, it's better to be direct and descriptive than trendy. Seasonal slogans such as \"Fall into savings\" or \"Sizzling summer bargains\" are popular but don't offer a specific hook. Instead, try to communicate the benefits of your promotions, or call attention to specific deals.\nKeep it short\nFor many recipients, especially those reading your emails on mobile devices, shorter is often better. We recommend you use no more than 9 words and 60 characters.\nLimit punctuation\nOur research shows that it\u2019s best to use no more than 3 punctuation marks per subject line. Too many punctuation marks can make your email look like spam, especially if you use a lot of special characters.\nUse emojis carefully\nOur built-in emoji picker is a fun and easy way to add some visual pizazz to your subject lines. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when you use emojis.\nAccording to our research, you should use no more than 1 emoji at a time.\nUse emojis to supplement words rather than replace them, to make sure your main message gets across.\nDifferent operating systems render different versions of emojis, so it\u2019s important to test.\nSegment your audience\nThink about who your subscribers are, and what kind of information is most useful to them. If sales reps, store owners, and consumers all receive the same campaign, some could become frustrated by irrelevant content and stop opening your emails. You can use subscriber location, interests, or activity to segment campaigns, so you can send the right content to the right people. Segmentation helps you create stronger campaigns and build trust with your subscribers. Segmenting your audience will increase the conversion rate and you'll get better email results than sending generic emails.\nReady to try what made us famous?\nCreate custom email campaigns, measure performance, and turn insights into results with Mailchimp\u2019s email marketing tools.\nSign up\nAudience segmentation tips\nOnce you\u2019ve decided which segmentation strategies to go with, you can put the rest of your plan together. How are you going to target those people? Will it be via email, social media, or personalized landing pages? Here are a few tips for marketing smarter with segmented email campaigns.\nKeep your segments more widely defined\nAlthough the point of audience segmentation is to aim for specificity, it\u2019s possible to segment your audience too far. It\u2019s essential to have a smaller market with a defined need. If your market is so narrowly defined that it barely contains anyone, however, that\u2019s a problem. You\u2019ll either reach too few people, or you\u2019ll end up spending time and energy writing messages for too many different audiences.\nFocus on a few groups, but keep those groups broad enough to encompass relatively wide swaths of your customer base.\nAim for constant improvement\nIf the combination of audience segmentation strategies you used didn\u2019t work, experiment with another mix until you find the most effective way to reach your potential customers. Measure the data to see where people are landing on your site, how long they\u2019re staying, and what\u2019s making them leave. Then incorporate that data into your next effort and into the day-to-day operations of your marketing.\nSet goals, then measure them\nMarketing goals are important. If your objective is to \u201creach more people,\u201d for example, define what you\u2019re looking to see from each of your segmented campaigns. That can include adding 500 more subscribers to your email newsletter, increasing the total number of products you sell by 20%, or doubling your email campaign\u2019s click-through rate.\nYou should also make sure that your goals for each segment and your company\u2019s overall goals are in sync with each other. Once you\u2019ve set those goals, track them. If you met them, great!\nIf not, some tweaking is necessary. Setting goals and measuring them is simple\u2014and it can provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of a marketing plan.\nUse different channels\nWhile email lists are absolutely key to communicating directly with your customers, there are more marketing channels you can explore when it comes to building better relationships and improving response rates.\nReach out to your customers with posts on social media on the platforms you know they\u2019re most likely to use. Does your company sell ethically made makeup products? See about working with a beauty influencer on Instagram. Do you run a digital marketing agency? Try building a strong presence on Twitter and LinkedIn.\nYou can also reach and provide value to your audiences through blogging, whether it\u2019s through your own site or someone else\u2019s. Write a blog post that details something useful and position yourself as an authority on your product.\nIf you\u2019ve got the skills or budget for it, try creating YouTube videos that are relevant to your target audience. Include links in the videos\u2019 descriptions to get more subscribers to your email list or blog.\nWhen you use different channels thoughtfully, you\u2019ll see a return on that effort in the form of increased interest, increased sales, and repeat customers.\nClick-through rates in email marketing statistics\nAnother good way to check how well your emails are working is to take a look at the click rates. The click rate is a percentage that tells you how many successfully delivered emails got at least 1 click. This number shows whether or not your audience finds the emails you send relevant enough to click through and check their email for more.\nHere\u2019s what standard click rates look like:\nHobbies have the highest click rate, which is 5.01%.\nMedia and publishing emails see the second highest click rate, at 4.62%.\nGovernment comes in third, with a 3.99% click rate.\nThe average click rate for all industries we looked at is 2.62%.\nThe average click rate for all industries we analyzed is 2.62%\nHow to improve click rates\nYour click rate essentially tells you how many of your subscribers find your campaign content useful. To improve your click rate, you'll need to create content that's useful to more subscribers. Like open rates, you can sometimes accomplish this by targeting specific content to a smaller, segmented audience.\nYou can also try changing your link text and testing content blocks in your campaigns.\nMake links more effective\nBest practice suggests avoiding the generic phrase \"click here\" as click-through text. Many people won't click it because it's unclear where it goes. It also leaves out important information screen readers need for disabled users, and suggests clicking a mouse, when a lot of people view their emails on a touchscreen.\nMake your link text descriptive and concise, and point the click-through URL to the most relevant information available. If you're referencing a particular service, send the link directly to that service's webpage instead of your business homepage.\nEmbed more links\nSome users have success with including multiple links to the same content in a single campaign. This is particularly helpful for campaigns with a single call to action, such as prompting your subscribers to donate.\nYou could put donation buttons in several content areas, or vary link text throughout your campaign. Instead of having a single donation link, you will have several, which increases the odds of someone clicking\u2014 even though every link points to the same target webpage. It's always a good idea to test your links.\nTesting content with A/B testing campaigns\nA/B testing campaigns can help you test a lot of things, including the actual content in your campaign. You'll create different versions of your content in a single A/B testing campaign, and Mailchimp will send each version to a separate set of subscribers in your audience and track engagement. The one that performs better is sent to a remaining set of your recipients who weren't sent any of the test versions.\nOpen and click rates improve when you provide the most relevant content to the most interested group of people. Make time to review your reports, and test often to get the most out of your campaigns. Testing is an important part of a digital marketing strategy.\nTips for Improving Your Email Marketing Stats\nWhen it comes to subject lines, being straightforward works best. So tell, don\u2019t sell what\u2019s inside. Read our tips on writing effective subject lines.\nIf you want people to open your emails, you have to get past their email spam filters first. And the best way to avoid spam filters is to learn how they work.\nToo many hard bounces is a sign of an old, stale list. Make sure you email your subscribers regularly (at least once a quarter), so that your list stays up to date.\nSoft bounces usually mean the recipient is \u201ctemporarily unavailable.\u201d Maybe they\u2019re on vacation, or their mailbox is full. You can keep those emails and try them again later, but Mailchimp auto-cleans soft bounces after 5 failed campaigns.\nHard bounces mean an email address failed. Maybe it no longer exists, or maybe someone made a typo when they subscribed to a list. But hard bounces might also be spam filter\u2014if you see an abnormally high number of bounces after a campaign, read your bounceback records for any messages or clues from spam filters.\nAbuse complaints happen when recipients click the \u201cThis is spam\u201d button in their email programs. That usually means that subscribers don\u2019t remember subscribing to your email list. Make sure your \u201cFrom\u201d and \u201cSubject\u201d lines contain your company name, so your subscribers will instantly recognize you. You can also use Mailchimp's email templates to ensure proper coding. Here are a few more tips for preventing spam complaints,\ncheck them out before sending emails to your subscribers.\nEmail marketing benchmarks FAQ\nWhat is an email marketing benchmark?\nAn email marketing benchmark is a metric used to see how successful an email marketing campaign has been for your business. Email marketing benchmarks use multiple factors when determining the success of a campaign, including the email open rate, click-through rate, and the size of your email list compared to the first two data points.\nWhat is a good open rate for email?\nOne of the biggest factors when determining the success of a marketing campaign is email open rates. When building an email list, you want to make sure that you provide quality content for users who want to read the content.\nEmail open rates, as it sounds, refer to the rate by which your email recipients open it. Ideally, you should aim for somewhere around 21.33 percent, though the industry your business is in may change that figure.\nFor example, the highest average email open rate is 28.77 percent for government emails, while the lowest average email open rate is 15.03 percent for vitamin supplement emails.\nWhat is a good CTR for email?\nThe click-through rate (CTR) of an email is one of the most important email marketing benchmarks in determining how successful your email marketing campaign is. The reason this is so is because, no matter how many people are registered on your email, or how many open their emails, if they do not click, it does not matter.\nOn average, the optimal CTR for an email marketing campaign is around 3 percent, however it may range from 2-5 percent depending on the industry. The lowest CTR of any industry is the restaurant industry, with 1.34 percent, and the highest average CTR is 'Hobbies', with 5.1 percent.\nThe CTR of the email is determined by whether someone clicked on an image, hyperlink, or a call-to-action (CTA) included in the email. A comparatively high CTR may indicate that the people subscribed to your email list are excited, or at least curious, about what you are offering them.\nThe CTR is typically determined by taking the total clicks and dividing that by the total number of emails delivered as part of your campaign.\nWhat is a well-sized email list?\nThe size of your email list matters and it will determine how many emails you send per person in a certain span of time. Like with email open rates, the size of your email list should ultimately depend on your industry, as well as the size of your business.\nThe size of your email list should take into account not only the average open rate as an email marketing benchmark, but also the conversion rate. The average conversion rate is around 3 percent. No matter how big your business is, however, you should strive to have at least 1000 subscribers.\nIf this number is any lower, you run the risk of having a too-low number of conversions. On average, half of your email list subscribers will be interested in your product or services, while the other half is less so.\nHow do I make my email list compliant?\nFiguring out the difference between compliant vs noncompliant is relatively tricky when it comes to email lists. There are certain things that are not allowed under a company's terms of service. To see if you are compliant, make sure to read through the terms of service of whichever company you are working with.\nReady to try what made us famous?\nCreate custom email campaigns, measure performance, and turn insights into results with Mailchimp\u2019s email marketing tools.\nSign up\nRelated Topics\nEmail A/B Testing\nEmail Marketing\nEmail Design Templates\nSend & Deliver Emails\nCreate an Email Campaign\nMeasure Email Performance\nShare This Article\nShare this article on Twitter\nShare this article on Linkedin\nShare this article on Facebook\nEmail this article\nRelated Links:\nAbout Email Campaign Reports\nAbout Open and Click Rates\nConversion Rate: What Is It & How to Calculate It\nProducts\nWhy Mailchimp?\nProduct Updates\nEmail Marketing\nWebsites\nTransactional Email\nHow We Compare\nGDPR Compliance\nSecurity\nStatus\nMobile App\nResources\nMarketing Library\nFree Marketing Tools\nMarketing Glossary\nIntegrations Directory\nCommunity\nAgencies & Freelancers\nDevelopers\nEvents\nCompany\nOur Story\nNewsroom\nGive Where You Live\nCareers\nAccessibility\nHelp\nContact Us\nHire an Expert\nHelp Center\nTalk to Sales\nFilms, podcasts, and original series that celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit.\nCheck it out\nExpert insights, industry trends, and inspiring stories that help you live and work on your own terms.\nLearn more\nThis page is now available in other languages.\nEnglish\nEspa\u00f1ol\nFran\u00e7ais\nPortugu\u00eas\nDeutsch\nItaliano\n\u00a92001-2022 All Rights Reserved.

You can copy and paste your XML data to the Source Data box, then click Load button. After you have done so, the Source Data box will turn into a graphical XML viewer and your XML data will be displayed as a node tree.\nStep 2: select the XML data you want to convert. Use the graphical XML viewer to navigate the XML node tree, find the node you want and click the radio button. If the seleted node is a simple XML element, only the content of that element will be converted. If the selected the node is a complex XML element, the content of all its child nodes will be converted. If you want to convert the whole XML document, you can select the root node. Click the Convert button, the selected XML data will be converted to a plain text file.\nYou can repeat Step 2 many times by selecting different nodes of your XML document.\nChoose the target file format, CSV or plain text, by clicking Options.\nOptions\nYou can use the following options to make the converted text in the format you desire.\nField Separator: Field separators will make the converted text easy to read or parse. You can specify how to separate the converted data fields. The default separator is a space. You can change it to any string of characters;\nTrim XML Format White Space: Some XML files contain spaces and line breakers for the purpose of formating so that the document can be displayed in a more readable pattern by a text editor. When converted to text, these formating white spaces may not be wanted. You can use this option to trim the unwanted white spaces.\nAdd Linebreakers to Rows: If you specify to trim formating white spaces, all the data fields will be converted to one long line. You can use this option to add a line breaker to the end of each row of the XML elements.\nindex.html;XML Editor;online XML Editor;\nhtmlToText.html;HTML to Text;online tool to extract text data from an HTML document;\nxml2xsd.html;XML to XSD;online tool to generate XML Schema from an XML document;\ngenXml.html;XSD to XML;online tool to generate testing XML data from an XML Schema;\nxmlToExcel.html;XML to Excel;online tool to convert XML document to Excel spreadsheet;\nexcelViewer.html;Online Excel;view or edit Excel spreadsheet online;"

Doch bei genauer Betrachtung, werden Sie feststellen, dass es einige Feinheiten und Unterschiede gibt, die erheblichen Einfluss auf Ihre Handyrechnung haben k\u00f6nnen. Es Lohnt sich also definitiv vor einem Kauf sich mit den wichtigsten Themen und Faktoren auseinander zu setzen!\nEs werden verschieden Internet Optionen angeboten. Es werden Internet Flatrates mit 5GB, 10GB oder noch mehr angeboten.\nBei uns finde Sie eine Reihe von Infos um das Themea \"Prepaid Karte\", wir bewerten die verschiedenen Anbieter und pr\u00e4sentieren Ihnen die beste Prepaid Karte in unserem kostenlosen Vergleich.\nWas bieten wir?\nKostenloser Vergleich von Prepaid Tarifen\n100% nur seri\u00f6se Anbieter\nTransparente Bewertungen\nH\u00e4ndisch gepr\u00fcfte Angebote\nWas genau sind Prepaid Karten?\nZun\u00e4chst, echtes Prepaid gilt nur dann, wenn Sie auch wirklich vor dem Verbrauch der Leistungen bereits die Leistung bezahlt haben.\n1. Die SIM Karte kaufen\n2. Guthaben aufladen\n3. Telefon, SMS und Internet nutzen bis das Guthaben leer ist\nDaf\u00fcr steht Prepaid. Das bietet den Vorteil, dass es erst gar nicht m\u00f6glich ist Schulden anzuh\u00e4ufen. Sobald Ihr Guthaben aufgebraucht ist, k\u00f6nnen Sie, auch keine weiteren kostenpflichtigen Leistung mehr in Anspruch nehmen. Im Mobilfunk-Bereich gibt es jedoch noch zwei weitere g\u00e4ngige Abrechnungsmodelle. Postpaid und der monatlich k\u00fcndbare Tarife.\nVon Vodafone, o2 und Lebara erh\u00e4lt man sogar Gratis SIM Karten d.h. man muss f\u00fcr die Bestellung nichts zahlen.\nPostpaid bedeutet, wie der Name schon sagt, eine Abrechnung nach dem Verbrauch der Leistungen. Dies ist f\u00fcr kontrollierte Handybenutzer sehr angenehm und bequem denn die Sim Karte muss nicht dauerhaft aufgeladen werden. Diese Karten eigenen sich besonders gut f\u00fcr z.B. Alarmanlagen. Dennoch birgt es die Gefahr der un\u00fcbersehbaren Kosten. F\u00fcr Kinder und Jugendliche ist dieses Abrechnungsmodell unter keinen Umst\u00e4nden geeignet. Auch f\u00fcr den \u201e1-Monat Vertrag\u201c, der enorme Flexibilit\u00e4t erm\u00f6glicht, k\u00f6nnen Sie zwischen beiden Abrechnungsmethoden w\u00e4hlen. Wir haben alle Vorteile und Nachteile sowie erg\u00e4nzende Hintergrundinformationen, in unserem Ratgeber oder unterhalb der Tariflisten f\u00fcr Sie zusammengestellt.\nWas ist wichtig zu wissen?\nAls aller erstes sollten Sie sich \u00fcber Ihr eigenes Nutzungsprofil und m\u00f6gliche kommunikative Bed\u00fcrfnisse bewusst werden.\nSie sollten sich folgende Fragen Stellen:\nM\u00f6chte ich ein bestimmtes Handynetz?\nM\u00f6chte ich m\u00f6glich g\u00fcnstig Telefonieren oder sind mir qualit\u00e4t und Service wichtig?\nBrauche ich Internet auf dem Handy?\nSobald Sie einen \u00dcberblick haben m\u00fcssen Sie sich lediglich zwischen Handynetzen, Vertragsbedingungen, Regelungen zum Anbieterwechsel, Mobilen Internet, Freiminuten oder SMS Kontingenten entscheiden. Als w\u00e4re das bereits nicht genug haben Sie, obendrauf die Auswahl zwischen hunderten verschiedenen und individuellen Zusatzoptionen f\u00fcr Ihren Tarif. Solche Zusatzoptionen k\u00f6nnen in allen unterschiedlichen Bereichen vorgefunden werden.\nWenige Anbieter stellen Ihnen auch kostenloses monatliches Internet zur Verf\u00fcgung. Die Finanzierung solcher Angebote tr\u00e4gt sich i.d.r. durch Werbung. In der schnelllebigen Mobilfunkbranche finden Sie auch des \u00d6fteren ausgezeichnete Angebote die mit besonders g\u00fcnstigen und vorteilhaften Vertragsbedingungen locken. Bitte bedenken Sie jedoch immer, dass kurzzeitige Angebote nur f\u00fcr Sie von Vorteil sind wenn die offerierten Leistungen auch wirklich mit Ihrem Nutzungsprofil \u00fcbereinstimmen.\nWie das Guthaben aufladen?\nF\u00fcr die Guthabenaufladung gibt es mehrere M\u00f6glichekeiten.\nPer SMS, Telefon, am Geldautomat, an Tankstellen oder direkt im Internet.\nDie wohl h\u00e4ufigste Methode ist die Guthabenkarte d.h. man Kauft eine Kreditkarten-Gro\u00dfe Karte am Automaten, in einer Tankstelle oder eine Handyshop. Auf der Guthabenkarte ist ein 25 stelliger Code. Der Code wird \u00fcber die Tastatur am Handy eingeben und daraufhin das Guthabenkonto aufgeladen. G\u00e4ngig Guthabenaufladungen sind 15 \u20ac, 30 \u20ac oder 50 \u20ac\nEine weitere M\u00f6glichkeit ist die automatisch Aufladung. Dabei wird die Prepaidkarte automatisch um einen bestimmten Betrag aufgeladen, wenn das Guthabenkonto unter einen bestimmten Betrag f\u00e4llt. Vorher erh\u00e4lt man einem Hinweis \u00fcber das niedrig Guthaben per SMS.\nFalls Sie eine Prepaid Karte ohne Aufladezwang suchen bieten sich Tarife ohne Grundgeb\u00fchr an die aber nur als Postpaid-Varianten angeboten werden.\nStartguthaben vs.Extraguthaben\nDie Mobilfunkanbieter umwerben Ihre potenziellen Kunden mit einer Vielzahl von unterschiedlichen Rabattmodellen. Zwei g\u00e4ngige Methoden sind das Startguthaben und das Extraguthaben. Wie der Name \u201eStartguthaben\u201c bereits verr\u00e4t, handelt es sich dabei um eine einmalige Gutschrift die Ihnen bei der Aktivierung Ihres Vertrags gutgeschrieben wird. In der Regel ist das ein Betrag zwischen 10\u20ac, 15\u20ac und 50\u20ac. Das Extraguthaben ist ebenfalls eine Gutschrift, die jedoch mehrmalig gezahlt werden kann z.B.: 15\u20ac in den ersten 3 Monaten. Die exakten Konditionen einer Gutschrift sind individuell vom Mobilfunkanbieter abh\u00e4ngig und sollten vor jedem Vertragsabschluss gr\u00fcndlich \u00fcberpr\u00fcft werden.\nPreis pro Minute/ Zubuchbare Tarifoptionen\nIm Bereich der Prepaid Karten Tarife haben sich mehrere Tarifstrukturen durchgesetzt. Es gibt Tarife mit besonders g\u00fcnstigen Grundkonditionen f\u00fcr Telefonie (6 Cent, 7,5 Cent pro Minute) und Angebote mit etwas h\u00f6heren Kosten pro Minute Telefonie (9 Cent und 15 Cent pro Minute) die dann oft als Ausgleich g\u00fcnstige buchbare Zusatzoptionen anbieten. Zusatzoptionen sind Erweiterungen Ihrer Tarifkonditionen um eine SMS Flat, Festnetz Flat, Internet Flat oder direkt eine Allnet Flat.\nEignen sich Prepaid Tarife f\u00fcr Tablets ?\nWer sich eine Tablet aneignen m\u00f6chte und dabei auf einen Laufzeitvertrag verzichtet wird bei Ebay oder Amazon f\u00fcndig. Dann brauchen Sie einen Prepaid Karte f\u00fcr Ihr Tablet das ist ein Datentarif der nur zum Surfen gedacht ist. Spezielle SIM Karten f\u00fcr das iPad gibt es bei allen Anbietern.\nSind g\u00fcnstige Prepaid Tarife schlechter als ein Vertrag?\nSo pauschal kann man dar\u00fcber keine konkrete Aussage treffen. Das wichtigste Kriterium ist die \u00dcbereinstimmung der Tarifkonditionen mit Ihrem Nutzungsverhalten. Angenommen Sie besitzen bereits ein Smartphone dann w\u00e4re es unsinnig einen Vertrag mit einem subventionierten Handy abzuschlie\u00dfen. Es w\u00e4re viel sinnvoller einen g\u00fcnstigen Prepaid Tarif in Anspruch zu nehmen. Mittlerweile gibt es viele Discounter Anbieter mit sehr g\u00fcnstigen Konditionen f\u00fcr Telefonie, SMS und Internet. Dazu geh\u00f6ren ALDI TALK, NettoKOM, LIDL Connect, winSIM, Rossmann, Penny, Edeka, ja mobil, blau.de u.v.m. Diese Anbieter agieren eigenst\u00e4ndig auf dem Mobilfunkmarkt und nutzen das Mobilfunknetz also die Technik der gro\u00dfen Netzanbieter, Telekom (Congstar), Vodafone (otelo) und o2.\nEchtes Prepaid und was man beachten sollte\nMit Prepaid Karten verbinden die meisten Menschen eine gewisse Kostenkontrolle. Diese trifft jedoch nur auf \u201eechtes Prepaid\u201c zu. Also nur auf Vertr\u00e4ge wo wirklich im Vorhinein bezahlt wird. Denn im Gegensatz zu Prepaid gibt noch gewisse Postpaid-Prepaid Angebote. Diese Tarife werben zwar f\u00fcr sich unter dem Decknamen \u201ePrepaid\u201c sind es jedoch nicht.\nBei Postpaid-Tarifen zahlen Sie erst nach dem Verbrauch der in Anspruch genommenen Leistungen d.h. alles was Sie vertelefonieren usw. landet am Ende des Monats auf Ihrer Rechnung. Somit besteht keine Kostenkontrolle die finden Sie nur bei echtem Prepaid vor. Ein weitere Vorteil von \"Echten\" Prepaid-Karten ist das diese auch ohne eine Bankverbindung und ohne Schufa-Abfrage gekauft werden k\u00f6nnen.\nDie Auswahl des richtigen Handynetz\nIn dem Mobilfunksektor gibt es eine H\u00fclle und F\u00fclle von unterschiedlichen Mobilfunkanbietern doch lediglich nur 4 unterschiedliche Mobilfunknetze. Das bedeutet, dass Sie sich immer zwischen diesen vorhandenen Handynetzen entscheiden m\u00fcssen. J\u00e4hrlich werden diese ausgiebig von verschiedenen Institutionen getestet. Dabei kommen Telefonie, SMS und Internet auf den Pr\u00fcfstand. Die Telekom belegt als Marktf\u00fchrer mit Ihrem D1-Netz stetig den ersten Platz. Danach folgt das D2-Netz von Vodafone. Der dritten Platz geht an das o2-Netz von Telef\u00f3nica. Ein Vorteil der geringen Netzauswahl in Deutschland ist die Netzkooperation aller anderen Anbieter. So bekommen Sie bei der richtigen Auswahl einen Discounter Tarif in dem besten Mobilfunknetz.\nHandynummer mitnehmen\nDie Portierung Ihrer Rufnummer ist heutzutage nur noch eine kleine Formalit\u00e4t. Sofern Sie einen neuen Vertrag gefunden haben m\u00fcssen Sie Ihren alten Anbieter fristgerecht k\u00fcndigen und die Mitnahme Ihrer Rufnummer beantragen. Bei dem Wechsel zwischen den Anbietern m\u00fcssen Sie darauf achten, dass Ihre Stammdaten identisch sind. Die Portierung selber wird im besten Fall mit einer Gutschrift verg\u00fctet und kostet im schlimmsten Fall 39\u20ac. Bei Prepaid Karten m\u00fcssen Sie noch eine Verzichtserkl\u00e4rung Ihrem alten Anbieter zukommen lassen. Damit verzichten Sie auf m\u00f6gliches Restguthaben auf Ihrer Sim Karte. Sofern Sie f\u00fcr die Portierung bezahlen m\u00fcssen, sollte sichergestellt sein, dass die Sim Karte mit ausreichend Guthaben gedeckt ist. Sobald alle Formalien erledigt sind k\u00f6nnen Sie nach einer kurzen Bearbeitungszeit die Sim Karte in Ihr Handy einlegen und die Aktivierung freischalten. Ausf\u00fchrliche Infos finden Sie au\u00dferdem in unserem Ratgeber \u201eHandyvertrag k\u00fcndigen\u201c.\nNeue Rufnummer\nFalls Sie noch keine Rufnummer haben erhalten Sie bei der Bestellung automatisch eine neue Rufnummer. Bei manchen Anbietern k\u00f6nnen Sie sogar eine Handynummer aussuchen und erhalten so die Wunschnummer die Sie gerne h\u00e4tten.\nGeb\u00fchren bei Auslandstelefonaten und Datenroaming\nDer Zustand f\u00fcr Telekommunikationsleistungen und Datenroaming im europ\u00e4ischen Ausland sind in den letzten Jahren deutlich verbessert worden. Seit Juli 2013 gibt es eine von der Eu verordnete Preisobergrenze (50\u20ac) f\u00fcr das Surfen im Ausland (z.B.: Norwegen, \u00d6sterreich, Niederlande, Luxemburg, Spanien Frankreich, Belgien usw.). Nichtsdestotrotz \u00fcbersteigen die Preise vielfach die Geb\u00fchren im Vergleich zu Leistungen innerhalb Deutschlands. Zum Gl\u00fcck werden spezifische Sim Karten f\u00fcr bestimmte Auslandsziele auf der ganzen Welt angeboten. So w\u00fcrde es durchaus sinnvoll sein vor einer Reise nach New York sich eine U.S.A Sim Karte zu organisieren. Einheimische Sim Karten sind immer die g\u00fcnstigste Alternative und lassen sich auch problemlos f\u00fcr Ziele der weiteren Welt wie z.B.: Namibia oder Thailand einfach beschaffen.\nMobiles Internet bei Prepaid und die passende Internet Flat\nEine Prepaid Karte ohne Internet die man nur zum telefonieren verwenden kann wird kaum noch angeboten. Die Vorteile der dauerhaften Verf\u00fcgung des Internets auf Ihrem Smartphone werden von den Kunden gut angenommen. Ein Gro\u00dfteil der Kommunikation kann sogar direkt \u00fcber das gebuchte Datenvolumen abgewickelt werden.\nInstant Messenger bieten, sich als sehr kosteng\u00fcnstige Kommunikations-Variante an und sind weit verbreitet. Die Angebote im Bereich des mobilen Internet schwanken zwischen MB genauer Abrechnung und einem mtl. inklusiven Datenvolumen von bis zu 10 GB. Wie viel Datenvolumen Sie letztlich im Monat ben\u00f6tigen h\u00e4ngt voll und ganz von Ihrem Nutzungsverhalten ab. 500 MB reichen aus um zu surfen und Messenger zu nutzen. Sofern Sie Videos schauen m\u00f6chten und regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Multimedia Inhalte verwenden, sollten Sie ein Datenvolumen von 1 GB/Monat oder mehr buchen. Eine Aufstellung von Anwendungen und dem dabei verbrauchten Datenvolumen finden Sie in der Ratgeber Kategorie \u201eWie viel Datenvolumen ben\u00f6tige ich?\u201c.\nWie alt muss man mindestens sein bei der Bestellung?\nDer Kauf einer Prepaid Karte ist bei den meisten Anbietern ab einem Alter von 16 J. m\u00f6glich. Zur Registrierung wird der Personalausweis ben\u00f6tigt. Anders sieht es bei Prepaid Vertr\u00e4gen aus. Ein Vertragsabschluss ist dann erst ab dem Alter von 18 Jahren wirksam d.h. der Vertragspartner muss voll gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00e4hig sein. Wenn vor dem 18. Lebensjahr ein Vertrag zustande kommen soll, muss eine Einwilligungserkl\u00e4rung der Erziehungsberechtigten vorliegen.\nEinzelverbindungsnachweis bei Prepaid Karten?\nAuch bei Prepaid Karten besteht permanent die M\u00f6glichkeit einer Einsicht aller verursachten Kosten. Einzelverbindungsnachweise finden Sie online kostenlos (per E-mail oder auf der Webseite des Vertragspartners). Die postalische Variante in Form eines Papierausdrucks erfordert eine Beteiligung der Kosten von ca. 2\u20ac.\nExterne Links f\u00fcr Handynews\nIm Netz gibt es rund um das Thema \u201eMobilfunk\u201c etliche Informationsquellen.

If your credit is good, a series of related operations ensures that you get the book and the bookstore gets your money. However, if a single operation in the series fails during the exchange, the entire exchange fails. You do not get the book and the bookstore does not get your money.\nThe technology responsible for making the exchange balanced and predictable is called transaction processing. Transactions ensure that data-oriented resources are not permanently updated unless all operations within the transactional unit complete successfully. By combining a set of related operations into a unit that either completely succeeds or completely fails, you can simplify error recovery and make your application more reliable.\nTransaction processing systems consist of computer hardware and software hosting a transaction-oriented application that performs the routine transactions necessary to conduct business. Examples include systems that manage sales order entry, airline reservations, payroll, employee records, manufacturing, and shipping.\nThis section provides both general information on transaction processing, and specific information on how to write transactional applications and resource managers using the Microsoft .NET Framework.\nIn This Section\nTransaction Fundamentals\nIntroduces basic transaction processing terms and concepts.\nFeatures Provided by System.Transactions\nDiscusses how you can use features in System.Transactions to write your own transactional application.\nReference\nSystem.Transactions\nProvides classes that allow your code to participate in transactions.

Mythics have reached their final stage of eveloution, earning $APE daily\nStaking will be released following the final batch mint, with level ups and contests released shortly after.\nHave questions?\nHere are some answers to commonly asked questions. Did we miss something? DM us on Twitter to ask anything else.\nIs registering for a PREMINT list safe?\nYes. Over 1 million list registrations have happened on PREMINT without issue. When you sign in with PREMINT, you only are validating ownership of the wallet address. PREMINT does not get any permissions to perform transactions, and does not have any way of withdrawing anything from your wallet.\nWho else has used PREMINT?\nPremint has been used by some of the top artists and collections in the NFT ecosystem, including XCOPY, Coldie, DeekayMotion, Cool Cats, Known Origin, Async Art, Shaq, and over 1,000 more.\nWhy does PREMINT ask permission to \u201csuggest transactions to approve\u201d when logging in with MetaMask?\nMetaMask\u2019s standard text for anyone connecting their wallet (as of 3/2022) is \u201cSee address, account balance, activity, and suggest transactions to approve.\u201d We don\u2019t have any control over that and you\u2019ll see that message when signing into any site with MetaMask.\nWhy do I need to \u201cSign\u201d a message in addition to connecting my wallet.\nSigning is the only way we can truly know that you are the owner of the wallet you are connecting. Signing is a safe, gas-less transaction that does not in any way give PREMINT permission to perform any transactions with your wallet.\nIf I disconnect my wallet or social networks after registering, will my entry still be valid?\nPREMINT saves your wallet and social info as a part of the registration step, so you can disconnect everything afterwards and your entry is still valid.\nIf I transfer the required NFT after registering, will my registration still be valid?\nAs far as PREMINT is concerned, yes, but the project owner might check that you still own the token before finalizing the list.\nDo you record my IP address?\nWhen you register, we store an encrypted version of your IP address and save it with your registration, but we never save or share your actual IP address and there is no way to get it from what we save.\nI registered, but the project says my wallet isn\u2019t on the list. What happened?\nIf you fully registered, the only way your wallet wouldn\u2019t be on the list of registered wallets is if the project removed it. PREMINT never deletes wallets from the list for any reason.\nIt says my Discord or Twitter are attached to a different wallet. How do I disconnect them?\nIf you don\u2019t know what wallet your Discord or Twitter are connected to, just go to https://sushifrens-allowlist.com and you can force-disconnect them.\nWhat is an \u201caccess list\u201d? Isn\u2019t it called a \u201cwhitelist\u201d?\nWhile creators are welcome to name their PREMINT projects whatever they like, we choose to use the term \"allow list\" or \"access list\" vs \"whitelist\". \"Whitelist\" could be considered exclusionary language, and the spirit of web3 is about inclusion.\nPowered by PREMINT"

You can of course add, remove or change the content any time you like and this can now be done directly from within the Article Manager. You can also change all of the content in all the campaigns linked to it with just a click.\nNEW: Smart Link Placement\u00a0\u2013 TNG searches your articles for your keywords and inserts your links contextually and strategically within your articles. Where the keyword has not been mentioned it can still place strategic links that appear 100% natural.\nNEW: Automatic Authority Links\u00a0\u2013 TNG can generate automated authority links and place them within your article, these are always placed contextually. This helps to give your article higher credibility, making it look totally authentic and natural.

Each time SEnukeTNG will pull in fresh, relevant content and if needed, even creating new accounts. You can also choose to re-use those same accounts again, building up authority, speeding the process up and reducing your overall campaign costs putting more money in your pocket\nNEW: Premium Social Network\u00a0\u2013 These sites are unlike regular Social Network sites in that they are not all built on the same platform but rather, they are unique to TNG. This means that the links created here will have much more value than any other links AND they are considerably more unique in the SEO world.\nUntil now you would have to create such links by hand, however SEnuke TNG will automate this entire process.

In addition this can be linked to several 3rd party tools which help to ensure all the pages you create with SEnuke TNG are fully indexed.\nEvery single link you create will be seen by the search engines when you use this tool.\nNEW: Built in OCR\u00a0- If you have ever filled in a form on the internet you will know all about CAPTCHA, there are those little hard to read images that websites make you try and decipher. In the past you had to pay to solve all of these but now SEnuke TNG has OCR built, we can even solve most Recaptcha!\nYou no longer need to purchase 3rd party OCR services, if we can\u2019t solve it they can\u2019t either!\n2Captcha Integration\u00a0\u2013 There are of course some CAPTCHA types which OCR can't solve, and for these we have now integrated additional external solving services. Of particular interest is 2Captcha offers manual solving of captcha that can't be solved by OCR for about 1/3 the cost of other services, in addition they can solve the new Google NoCaptcha and Funcaptcha too.\nThat's right SEnuke TNG can post your links to sites using the very latest in Google anti-bot defences!\nGet Instant Access\nNew: Built in Proxies Now With Rotation\u00a0- SEnuke TNG now uniquely includes thousands of unlimited use proxies for you to Nuke with. These are not regular free proxies but premium proxies direct from leading suppliers.\nIn addition, SEnuke TNG now will use multiple verified proxies during the SAME campaign\u2026automatically.\nThese are in addition to the over 100,000 proxies included for use with the Crowsearch feature. This many proxies alone would cost you $X00's a month!\nGet Instant Access\nHere\u2019s Some Proof of Rankings Achieved\nwith SEnuke TNG Pro\nDuring our extensive testing we ran some campaigns for moneysites sites, here are just a few of the outstanding results we got.\nWizard Campaigns\nThe first three show results from running SEnuke TNG Wizard campaigns. We used the very same exact templates you will be receiving as a bonus when you purchase today!\nA car credit referral site, with a nice CPA income, with results showing in a matter of days pushing the site from number 4 all the way to number 1!\nWe can see towards the end of the time line the results starting to 'dance' a little, this would be a great time to run another small high quality SEnuke campaign and lock that No1 status in rock solid.\nThe same niche but another town variation, SEnuke TNG is perfect for such niches as you can target your keywords with laser point precision.\nThis time we were moving not just the sub-page but also the home page!\nAt the start of the campaign the sub-page was ranking 8 while the home was ranking 9, initially ran 1 small campaign and use the new 'Duplicate' feature of SEnuke TNG to make the same campaign run again 1 week later, before the first had even finished.\nWe got the classic 'dance' just the same as the previous example but this time took some action with a small campaign using only the very best SEnuke sites and instantly powered our way back to positions 2 & 3.\nThe most interesting thing though is how the two pages switched places, now the home page was out ranking the sub-page.\nThis shows that the domain as a whole has become more niche orientated, you can be sure that along with this ranking the home page is now ranking of a whole host of longtail keywords that it was not before!\nHere we took things slow and just ran a simple 2 Tier template over a week, and then sat bank and watched the rankings grow.\nYou will see there was no dance this time, so we will let that one sit for a while and then promote it some more to grab that No.1 spot!\nRemember this is just one keyword, with SEnuke TNG you can target hundreds or even thousands of keywords at once. Creating an avalanche of traffic for your sites!\nGet Instant Access\nCrowdsearcher Campaigns\nClicks & CTR\u00a0- here you can see the sites had effectively no clicks (blue line), and thus no CTR, we then ran CrowdSearch module and Webmaster tools itself reported the clicks back to us. You can see the CTR rate is almost 100%, which is extremely high. These clicks come from X00,000's of residential IPs around the world to simulate real users.\nWebsite Rank\u00a0- Taken over a longer period of time we can see how the sites rank increased. With CrowdSearch it is typical to see no results for some period of time and then\u00a0jump\u00a0up the ranks out of nowhere. This is clearly seem in the first example, where there was little to talk about for quite some time and then a sudden jump.\nIn the second case the site was not even in the top 100, and ended up hovering around the position 20 mark. A sensible thing here would be to run an SEnuke Wizard campaign to boost the site up.\nClicks, CTR & Rank\u00a0- Here we see your typical 1000 searches a month keyword, which is requiring just a couple of clicks a day average to jump up the ranks.\nThe CTR in this campaign may appear to be low, but there is a solid reason for this. CTR amounts shown also of course takes in to account genuine searches, so if we are putting in 5 clicks a day but there are also 20 natural clicks then we have:\n(5/25)*100= 20% daily of the clicks.\nYou could throw more clicks at it, but it's just not needed and you are better off using them on other sites.\nAs you move up the ranks you will start to get more of these natural clicks, and once at the top you can in theory turn off the CrowdSearch because being in the top spot you should be getting the clicks anyway!\nThis process can be seen at around 2/3 the way along in the picture. Despite us sending approximately the same number of clicks each day our total clicks jumps.\nWhy?\nSimply because our rank has increased so we are getting more natural clicks, we then turned down the CrowdSearch tool so you see the click drop down as we are now getting only the natural clicks, but the rankings remain!\nYou can then move your attention on to your next keyword,\u00a0rank domination has never been easier!\nWhen You Purchase SEnuke TNG Pro Today You Also Receive Two Valuable Bonuses To Help You Rank Even Faster!\nBonus One:You Get PROVEN Plug N Play SEnuke Campaign Templates (Available Only During Launch)\nBonus 2:You Get the WP Silo plugin to Optimize the Structure Your WordPress Sites.\nOnly $97\nGet It Now\n30 DayMoney Back\nNo Questions\nSecureCheckout\nPowered by JVzoo\nPrivacyProtected\n\u00a9 2021 \u00b7 SEnuke.com \u00b7 All Rights Reserved\nBuy 3 License Edition |\u00a0Support | Terms of Service | Privacy Notice\nEarning Disclaimer\nHide\n+\nThe information presented to you by SEnuke.com is intended to be for your educational and entertainment purposes only.\nWe are not presenting you with a business opportunity.\nWe are not presenting you with a distributorship.\nWe are not making any claims as to income you may earn.\nWe are not presenting you with an opportunity to get rich.\nBefore embarking on any endeavor, please use caution and seek the advice your own personal professional advisors, such as your attorney and your accountant.\nWhere income figures are mentioned (if any), those income figures are anecdotal information passed on to us concerning the results achieved by the individual sharing the information.

\u2022 The quality or state of being secure\u2014to be free from danger\u201d \u2022 A successful organization should have multiple layers of security in place:\n\u2022 Physical security \u2022 Personal security\n\u2022 Operations security\n\u2022 Communications security\n\u2022 Network security \u2022 Information securityCharacteristics of Information \u2022 The value of information comes from the characteristics it possesses:\n\u2022 Availability \u2022 Accuracy \u2022 Authenticity \u2022 Confidentiality \u2022 Integrity \u2022 Utility \u2022 PossessionPhysical Design Physical design of an information security program is made up of two parts: \u2022 Security technologies \u2022 Physical security Physical design process:\n\u2022 select specific technologies. -Identifies complete technical solutions based on these technologies (deployment, operations and maintenance elements) -Design physical security measures to support the technical solution.Firewalls A software or hardware component that restricts network communication between two computers or networks. \tIn buildings, a firewall is a fireproof wall that restricts the spread of a fire. \tNetwork firewall prevents threats from spreading from one network to another \u2022\nPrevent specific types of information from moving between the outside world (untrusted networks) and the inside world (trusted networks)\n\u2022 The firewall may be a separate computer system, a software service running on an existing router all server, or a separate network containing a number of supporting devices.Internet FirewallsThe Internet Protocol StackWhat Firewalls do Protects the resources of an internal network. \t- Restrict external access.\n- Log Network activities. \t-Intrusion detection \t-DoS\n- Act as intermediary\n- Centralized Security Management \u2022 Carefully administer one firewall to control internet traffic of many machines. \u2022 Internal machines can be administered with less care.Types of Firewalls (General) \u2022 Firewalls types can be categorized depending on: \u2022 The Function or methodology the firewall use \u2022 Whether the communication is being done between a single node and the network, or between two or more networks.\n\u2022 Whether the communication state is being tracked at the firewall or not. Types of Firewalls 2.With regard to the scope of filtered communications the done between a single node and the network, or between two or more networks there exist : \u2022 Personal Firewalls, a software application which normally filters traffic entering or leaving a single computer.\n\u2022 Network firewalls, normally running on a dedicated network device or computer positioned on the boundary of two or more networks. Firewall categorization methods 1-The Function or methodology the firewall use Five processing modes that firewalls can be categorized by are : 1. packet filtering\n2.application gateways 3.circuit gateways\n4. MAC layer firewalls\n5.hybrids 1- packet filtering: \u2022 examine the header information of data packets that come into a network. \u2022 a packet filtering firewall installed on TCP/IP based network and determine wether to drop a packet or forward it to the next network connection based on the rules programmed in the firewall. \u2022 Packet filtering firewalls scan network data packets looking for violation of the rules of the firewalls database. \u2022 Filtering firewall inspect packets on at the network layers. \u2022 If the device finds a packet that matches a restriction it stops the packet from traveling from network to another.Packet Filtering (cont) \u2022 filters packet-by-packet,decides to Accept/Deny/Discard packet based on certain/configurable criteria \u2013Filter Rule sets. \u2022 Typically stateless: do not keep a table of the connection state of the various traffic that flows through them \u2022 Not dynamic enough to be considered true firewalls. \u2022 Usually located at the boundary of a network. \u2022 Their main strength points: Speed and Flexibility.*There are three subsets of packet filtering firewalls: -static filtering\n-dynamic filtering\n-stateful inspection static filtering: -requires that the filtering rules coverning how the firewall decides which packets are allowed and which are denied.\n-This type of filtering is common in network routers and gateways.Dynamic filtering - allows the firewall to create rules to deal with event.\n-This reaction could be positive as in allowing an internal user to engage in a specific activity upon request or negative as in dropping all packets from a particular address\nStateful inspection\n-keep track of each network connection between internal and external systems using a state table.\n-A state table tracks the state and context of each packet in the conversation by recording which station send , what packet and when.\n-More complex than their constituent component firewalls\n-Nearly all modern firewalls in the market today are stafulStateful Inspection FirewallsBasic Weaknesses Associated with Packet Filters\\ Statful \u2022 They cannot prevent attacks that employ application-specific vulnerabilities or functions.\n\u2022 Logging functionality present in packet filter firewalls is limited \u2022 Most packet filter firewalls do not support advanced user authentication schemes. \u2022 Vulnerable to attacks and exploits that take advantage of problems within the TCP/IP specification and protocol stack, such as network layer address spoofing. \u2022 Susceptible to security breaches caused by improper configurations.Packet Filtering Summary Advantages: \u2022 One packet filter can protect an entire network \u2022 Efficient (requires little CPU) \u2022 Supported by most routers Disadvantages: \u2022 Difficult to configure correctly\nMust consider rule set in its entirety \u2022 Difficult to test completely \u2022 Performance penalty for complex rulesets Stateful packet filtering much more expensive \u2022 Enforces ACLs at layer 3 + 4, without knowing any application detailsPacket Filtering Firewalls \u2022 The original firewall \u2022\nWorks at the network level of the OSI model \u2022\nApplies packet filters based on access Rules: \u2013 Source IP address \u2013 Destination IP address \u2013 Application or protocol \u2013 Source port number \u2013 Destination port numberPacket Filtering Firewalls Firewalls 2- application gateways: \u2022 is also known as proxy server since it runs special software that acts as a proxy for a service request. \u2022 One common example of proxy server is a firewall that blocks or requests for and responses to request for web pages and services from the internal computers of an organization. \u2022 The primary disadvantage of application level firewalls is that they are designed for a specific protocols and cannot easily be reconfigured to protect against attacks in other protocols. \u2022 Application firewalls work at the application layer.Application/Proxy Servers\u2026cont \u2022 Filters packets on application data as well as on IP/TCP/UDP fields. \u2022 The interaction is controlled at the application layer \u2022 A proxy server is an application that mediates traffic between two network segments. \u2022 With the proxy acting as mediator, the source and destination systems never actually \u201cconnect\u201d. \u2022 Filtering Hostile Code:\nProxies can analyze the payload of a packet of data and make decision as to whether this packet should be passed or dropped. .Application/Proxy Servers\u2026contApplication/Proxy Servers\u2026cont \u2022 No proxy, no Internet application \u2022 Typical proxies include: \u2022 FTP \u2022 SMTP, POP3 \u2022 Telnet \u2022 DNS \u2022 HttpApplication/Proxy Servers\u2026cont Advantages: \u2022 Extensive logging capability \u2022\nAllow security\nenforcement \u2022 of user authentication .\n\u2022\nless vulnerable to address \u2022\nspoofing attacks.\nDisadvantages: \u2022 Complex Configuration. \u2022 limited in terms of support for new \u2022\nnetwork applications and protocols.\n\u2022\nSpeed!!.3- circuit gateways: \u2022 operates at the transport layer. \u2022 Connections are authorized based on addresses , they prevent direct connections between network and another. \u2022 They accomplish this prevention by creating channels connecting specific systems on each side of the firewall and then allow only authorized traffic.circuit gateways ..cont \u2022 relays two TCP connections (session layer) \u2022 imposes security by limiting which such connections are allowed \u2022 once created usually relays traffic without examining contents \u2022 Monitor handshaking between packets to decide whether the traffic is legitimate\n\u2022 typically used when trust internal users by allowing general outbound connections \u2022 SOCKS commonly used for thisCircuit Level Firewalls Examplecircuit gateways ..cont Disadvantages Individual packets are not filtered. \u2022 Access control mechanisms are needed, since logs cant catch all the abuses. \u2013 Time limit on how long ports will last. \u2013 List of permissible outside called to the port. \u2022 The other big problem is need to provide new client program. \u2022 Code changes issues include availability of application source code for various platforms, version control, distribution and more.4- MAC layer firewalls: \u2022 design to operate at the media access control layer. \u2022 Using this approach the MAC addresses of specific host computers are linked to ACL entries that identify the specific types of packets that can be send to each host and all other traffic is blocked.5- Hybrids firewalls: \u2022 companied the elements of other types of firewalls , example the elements of packet filtering and proxy services, or a packet filtering and circuit gateways. \u2022 That means a hybrids firewalls may actually of two separate firewall devices; each is a separate firewall system, but they are connected so that they work together.General PerformanceTypes of Firewalls 3. Finally, Types depending on whether the firewalls keeps track of the state of network connections or treats each packet in isolation, two additional categories of firewalls exist: \u2022 Stateful firewall\n\u2022 Stateless firewallTypes of Firewalls ..cont Stateful firewall\nkeeps track of the state of network connections (such as TCP streams) traveling across it. \tStateful firewall is able to hold in memory significant attributes of each connection, from start to finish. These attributes, which are collectively known as the state of the connection, may include such details as the IP addresses and ports involved in the connection and the sequence numbers of the packets traversing the connection. Types of Firewalls ..cont Stateless firewall\nTreats each network frame (Packet) in isolation. Such a firewall has no way of knowing if any given packet is part of an existing connection, is trying to establish a new connection, or is just a rogue packet.\nThe classic example is the File Transfer Protocol, because by design it opens new connections to random ports.Network Address Translation (NAT) - Existed for a short period of time; now NAT is part of every firewall -Developed in response to two major issues in network engineering and security:\n\u2022 First, network address translation is an effective tool for hiding the network-addressing schema present behind a firewall environment.\n\u2022 Second, the depletion of the IP address space has caused some organizations to use NAT for mapping non-routable IP addresses to a smaller set of legal addresses.Network Address Translation ..cont NAT goals \u2013 Allow use of internal IP-addresses \u2013 Hide internal network structure \u2013 Disable direct internet connections NAT-types \u2013 Dynamic \u2022 For connections from inside to outside \u2022There may be fewer outside addresses than internal addresses \u2013 Static \u2022 For connections from outside to specific servers inside \u2022 One-to-one address mapping (fixed)Network Address Translation ..contFirewall Configurations or (Architecture)\n\u2022 Packet Filtering Router\n\u2022 Dual Homed Gateway \u2022 Screened Host Gateway (bastion host ) \u2022 Screened Subnet Gateway or Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) \u2022 Firewall AppliancePacket Filtering Router \u2022 A packet filtering router is a router configured to screen packets between two networks. It routes traffic between the two networks and uses packet filtering rules to permit or deny traffic. Implementing security with a router is usually not that easy. Most routers were designed to route traffic, not to provide firewall functionality, so the command interface used for configuring rules and filters is neither simple nor intuitive.Dual Homed Gateway This is a secure firewall design comprising an application gateway and a packet filtering router. It is called \u201cdual homed\u201d because the gateway has two network interfaces, one attached to the Internet, the other to the organization's network. Only applications with proxy services on the application gateway are able to operate through the firewall. Since IP forwarding is disabled in the host, IP packets must be directed to one of the proxy servers on the host, or be rejected. Some manufacturers build the packet filtering capability and the application proxies into one box, thereby simplifying the design (but removing the possibility of having an optional info server and modems attached to the screened subnet,\ndisadvantages of the dual homed gateway are that it may be a bottleneck to performance, and it may be too secure for some sites (!) since it is not possible to let trusted applications bypass the firewall and communicate directly with peers on the Internet. They must have a proxy service in the firewall.Dual Homed Gateway ..cont \u2022 A dual-homed gateway typically sits behind the gateway (usually a router) to the untrusted network and most often is a host system with two network interfaces. Traffic forwarding on this system is disabled, thereby forcing all traffic between the two networks to pass through some kind of application gateway or proxy. Only gateways or proxies for the services that are considered essential are installed on the system. This particular architecture will usually require user authentication before access to the gateway/proxy is allowed. Each proxy is independent of all other proxies on the host system. Screened Host Gateway (bastion host ) The screened host gateway is similar to the above, but more flexible and less secure, since trusted traffic may pass directly from the Internet into the private network, thereby bypassing the application gateway. In this design the application gateway only needs a single network connection. The IP router will normally be configured to pass Internet traffic to the application gateway or to reject it. Traffic from the corporate network to the Internet will also be rejected, unless it originates from the application gateway. The only exception to these rules will be for trusted traffic that will be allowed straight through.Screened Host Gateway ..cont \u2022 The screened host, or bastion host, is typically located on the trusted network, protected from the untrusted network by a packet filtering router. All traffic coming in through the packet filtering router is directed to the screened host. Outbound traffic may or may not be directed to the screened host. This type of firewall is most often software based and runs on a general-purpose computer that is running a secure version of the operating system. Security is usually implemented at the application level. Screened Host Gateway ..cont \u2022 highly secure host system\n\u2022 potentially exposed to \"hostile\" elements\n\u2022 hence is secured to withstand this\n\u2022 may support 2 or more net connections \u2022 may be trusted to enforce trusted separation between network connections \u2022 runs circuit / application level gateways\n\u2022 or provides externally accessible services Screened Subnet Gateway This configuration creates a small isolated network between the Internet and the corporate network, which is sometimes referred to as the demilitarised zone (DMZ), The advantages of this configuration is that multiple hosts and gateways can be stationed in the DMZ, thereby achieving a much greater throughput to the Internet than the other configurations; plus the configuration is very secure as two packet filtering routers are there to protect the corporate network. The IP router on the Internet side will only let through Internet traffic that is destined for a host in the DMZ (and vice versa). The IP router on the corporate network side will only let site traffic pass to a host in the DMZ (and vice versa). This system is as secure as the dual homed gateway, but it is also possible to allow trusted traffic to pass straight through the DMZ if required. This configuration is of course more expensive to implement!Screened Subnet Gateway ..cont \u2022 A screened subnet or DMZ is typically created between two packet filtering routers. When using this architecture, the firewall solution is housed on this screened subnet segment along with any other services available to the untrusted network. Conceptually, this architecture is similar to that of a screened host, except that an entire network rather than a single host is reachable from the outside Firewall Appliance \u2022 A firewall appliance typically sits behind the gateway (usually a router) to the untrusted network. This architecture resembles the packet filtering router and dual-homed Gateway architectures in that all traffic must pass through the appliance. In most instances these appliances come pre-configured on their own box. They may also have other services built in, such as Web servers and e-mail servers. Because they usually don't need the extensive configuration that other firewalls often require, they are touted as being much simpler and faster to use. Some manufacturers market them as \"plug-and-play\" firewall solutions Firewall Appliance ..cont \u2022 For some networks, implementing more than one firewall solution may be a more effective option. For example, implement a packet filtering router at the entrance to the network for perimeter security and then configure an application gateway for a specific department or building. This type of solution would not only protect the trusted network from the outside, but would also protect a specific department or building from unauthorized users on the trusted network Load More ...\n\u00a9 2022 SlideServe | Powered By DigitalOfficePro\nAbout Us\nPrivacy\nDMCA\nContact\nBlog\n|"

        "legitimate": "Review of open source process simulators - Simulate Live\nToggle navigation\nHome\nSimulate\nSteady State\nDynamics\nOptimize\nAdvanced Process Control\nProcess\nDesign\nMonitoring\nOperator Training Simulators\nLearn\nWhite Papers\nLessons\nProduct reviews\nSimulation\nTraining Simulators\nOptimizers\nNews\nEvents\nJobs\nProcess simulation for process excellence\nSearch\n01.09.2021.\nProduct reviews\nSimulation\nReview of open source process simulators\nIt is not always necessary to use only expensive simulation packages\nSimulateLive.com\nTweet\nOne of the most important reasons that process simulation is not used more across the industry is the price of the simulation packages. Some of those most used software packages come together with the price reaching tens of thousands of USD for one license. Although, this price can be easily justified with the benefits achieved, it still very often remains an obstacle, especially for small engineering companies. Thanks to the hard-working and generous groups of experts who share their knowledge with all of us, this article presents some of the available open source process simulators.\u00a0However, they are not allowed to be used commercially.\n1. DWSIM\nDWSIM is a software for modeling, simulation, and optimization of steady-state chemical processes. It is the most popular open source simulation software that can be used for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. It is written in Visual Basic and features a comprehensive set of unit operations, advanced thermodynamic models, support for reacting systems, petroleum characterization tools, and a fully-featured graphical interface. Definitely should be one of the solutions on the top of your list if you are new in the process simulation or would like to get the results for a less complex process problem. It has the great number of important features, most of those that we are used to from using standard simulator packages. Some of them are:\nVLE, VLLE, SLE and Aqueous Electrolyte calculations using Equation of State, Activity Coefficient and Chao-Seader models,\nSupports CAPE-OPEN Unit Operations and Thermo 1.0/1.1 Property Packages,\nExposes Property Packages as CAPE-OPEN 1.1 Thermodynamic Equilibrium and Property Calculators,\nSupports ChemSep's Component Database and Column Model,\nProcess Flowsheet Diagram (PFD) Drawing Interface,\nRigorous Distillation/Absorption Column models,\nSupport for Chemical Reactions and Reactors,\nCharacterization of Petroleum Fractions using bulk properties and/or ASTM/TBP, distillation curves and creation of Hypothetical Components using UNIFAC groups,\nMultivariate Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis utility,\nExcel Interface for Thermodynamic Calculations,\nStandalone Thermodynamics Library,\nComponent Creator Utility for user-defined components.\nUntil then, you can find out more about DWSIM here and download the software using this download link.\n2. COCO simulator\nThe other process simulator that comes\u00a0with the bunch of features is called COCO. Behind this exotic name is another free-of-charge process simulator, non-commercial, graphical, modular and CAPE-OPEN compliant simulator for steady-state and sequential simulation process modeling. It was originally intended as a test environment for CAPE-OPEN modeling tools but now provides a free chemical process simulation for students. It is an open flowsheet modeling environment allowing anyone to add new unit operations or thermodynamics packages.\nA list of features includes:\nThermodynamics for Engineering Applications,\nthe CAPE-OPEN Unit-operations Simple package is shipped with COCO. It contains a splitter, a mixer, heat exchangers, pumps and reactors amongst other unit operations.\nReaction Numerics package.\nThe free package comes with certain limitations in calculations, such as limitation to 40 compounds, but can definitely be used for some simplified or short-cut modeling. What is especially beneficial\u00a0is the collection of free sample flow sheets available for download at their web-site. Sample flow sheets include prepared examples such as:\nPressure swing azeotropic distillation of methanol and acetone,\nBenzene-toluene-xylene divided wall column,\nMethanol synthesis from syngas,\nCombined heat and power cycle.\nTo download the software, follow this link.\n3. OPEN MODELICA\nOPENMODELICA is an open-source Modelica-based modeling and simulation environment intended for industrial and academic usage. Its long-term development is supported by a non-profit organization \u2013 the Open Source Modelica Consortium (OSMC). Modelica is not a process oriented simulator such as DWSIM, but a general modeling tool and the platform closer to Matlab.\nOpenModelica is a comprehensive compilation and simulation environment based on free software distributed in binary and source code form for research, teaching, and industrial usage.\nThere is a long list of industrial and university members including ABB, Siemens, Evonik etc.\nModeling using OpenModelica enables:\nMulti-domain modeling\nHybrid modeling\nVisual component modeling etc.\nOne example of how to use OpenModelica is\u00a0ABB OPTIMAX\u00ae model that provides advanced model-based control products for power generation and water utilities. Plant models are typically formulated in Modelica and deployed through FMI 2.0. The optimizing control applications maximize the efficiency and provide more flexibility to large conventional power plants that face frequent load ramps and start-ups. Moreover, they aggregate small renewable units to large virtual power plants. This enables renewables to provide grid services like power/frequency control, achieving grid stability despite of high penetration of renewable power and raising revenues. ABB uses several compatible Modelica tools, including OpenModelica, depending on specific application needs. OpenModelica provides debugging features that help to save a lot of time during model development.\nTo download OpenModelica software, please follow this link.\nRelated\nSimulation\nWhat is the Most Useful Software in Chemical Engineering?\nThe List of Most Important Calculation Tools\nSimulation\nComplete List of Process Simulators (Part 1/2)\nReview of simulation software for industrial plants\nSimulation\nTop 3 Programming Languages for Chemical Engineers\nWhat are best programming tools for solving chemical engineering problems?\nFollow us\nMost popular\nLessons\nDownload 10 Steps to Energy Efficiency Improvement\nOverview of Required Steps for Implementation of Energy Efficiency Projects\nLessons\n20 Small Business Ideas for Chemical Engineers\nBest Opportunities for Chemical Engineers Who Want to Build Their Own Business\nMonitoring\nHow to Use Predictive Analytics to Build Your Own Business in Chemical Engineering\nThe Power of Process Data in the Hands of Chemical Engineers\nAbout\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCompany Profiles\nContent\nNews\nEvents\nJobs\nSimulate\nSteady State\nDynamics\nOptimize\nAdvanced Process Control\nProcess\nDesign\nMonitoring\nOperator Training Simulators\nLearn\nWhite Papers\nLessons\nProduct reviews\nSimulation\nTraining Simulators\nOptimizers\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSend\n\u00a9 2022 SimulateLive.com / design: Rappa / code: Artkod\nYour browser does not support JavaScript.

Mythics have reached their final stage of eveloution, earning $APE daily\nStaking will be released following the final batch mint, with level ups and contests released shortly after.\nHave questions?\nHere are some answers to commonly asked questions. Did we miss something? DM us on Twitter to ask anything else.\nIs registering for a PREMINT list safe?\nYes. Over 1 million list registrations have happened on PREMINT without issue. When you sign in with PREMINT, you only are validating ownership of the wallet address. PREMINT does not get any permissions to perform transactions, and does not have any way of withdrawing anything from your wallet.\nWho else has used PREMINT?\nPremint has been used by some of the top artists and collections in the NFT ecosystem, including XCOPY, Coldie, DeekayMotion, Cool Cats, Known Origin, Async Art, Shaq, and over 1,000 more.\nWhy does PREMINT ask permission to \u201csuggest transactions to approve\u201d when logging in with MetaMask?\nMetaMask\u2019s standard text for anyone connecting their wallet (as of 3/2022) is \u201cSee address, account balance, activity, and suggest transactions to approve.\u201d We don\u2019t have any control over that and you\u2019ll see that message when signing into any site with MetaMask.\nWhy do I need to \u201cSign\u201d a message in addition to connecting my wallet.\nSigning is the only way we can truly know that you are the owner of the wallet you are connecting. Signing is a safe, gas-less transaction that does not in any way give PREMINT permission to perform any transactions with your wallet.\nIf I disconnect my wallet or social networks after registering, will my entry still be valid?\nPREMINT saves your wallet and social info as a part of the registration step, so you can disconnect everything afterwards and your entry is still valid.\nIf I transfer the required NFT after registering, will my registration still be valid?\nAs far as PREMINT is concerned, yes, but the project owner might check that you still own the token before finalizing the list.\nDo you record my IP address?\nWhen you register, we store an encrypted version of your IP address and save it with your registration, but we never save or share your actual IP address and there is no way to get it from what we save.\nI registered, but the project says my wallet isn\u2019t on the list. What happened?\nIf you fully registered, the only way your wallet wouldn\u2019t be on the list of registered wallets is if the project removed it. PREMINT never deletes wallets from the list for any reason.\nIt says my Discord or Twitter are attached to a different wallet. How do I disconnect them?\nIf you don\u2019t know what wallet your Discord or Twitter are connected to, just go to https://sushifrens-allowlist.com and you can force-disconnect them.\nWhat is an \u201caccess list\u201d? Isn\u2019t it called a \u201cwhitelist\u201d?\nWhile creators are welcome to name their PREMINT projects whatever they like, we choose to use the term \"allow list\" or \"access list\" vs \"whitelist\". \"Whitelist\" could be considered exclusionary language, and the spirit of web3 is about inclusion.\nPowered by PREMINT"

Check it out!Hi Grimro, thank you for taking part in the interview! Please introduce yourself.Yo what is up Grim here, I\u2019m a Path of Exile Streamer and Youtuber best known for currency making and Path of Exile science content. What is Science content you might ask? If the community has a question about anything in the game about a new mechanic or how rare an item is off a boss, I\u2019m your man and I\u2019m keen to grind out the answers.When did you first get into Path of Exile?I first got into Path of Exile after watching one of my favorite streamers Kripparrian pick up the game in the early beta phase back when there were only 2 acts!At the time Hardcore was the primary way to play and if you werent playing it you werent really playing Path of Exile. It\u2019s fair to say I got completely blasted in hardcore and quickly put the game down in favour of just enjoying streams and content.I dabbled in Softcore Path of Exile here and there but only really found myself playing seriously in the Essence league after the release of the Atlas of Worlds. This is what I would consider my true start.What one thing caught your attention in the beginning and what one thing kept you coming back?The thing that initially got me into Path of Exile alongside so many others was the expansive skill tree and skill gem system. What got me back for round two and really invested in Essence league was absolutely the Atlas of Worlds though.The reason I keep coming back to Path of Exile is the fresh leagues and economy we get every three months. The week leading up to a league start, planning out your build, progression and various strategies alongside your friends all culminating in a launch day of insane gaming successes, failures and new discoveries is truly something I haven\u2019t found anywhere else.Are there any highlights from your time playing Path of Exile that stand out in your memory?My fondest Path of Exile memory is of the Ritual league when player power and what you could do in the game was at its absolute highest (maybe a little too high). The combination of Full power Harvest crafting alongside some truly absurd skills and ways to scale them allowed for you to build characters nothing like anyone had seen before.Flying through 100% Delirium Canyon maps on Self Poison Cold Blade Vortex with 800%+ movement speed while my computer ran the game at approximately 2 frames per second due to all the monsters and effects going off was truly something I\u2019ll never forget. In fact I\u2019m smiling typing this right now.Do you have a favourite build?This may surprise some people who follow my content\u2026 but my favorite build without a doubt is Deadeye Tornado Shot, of which I\u2019ve played as my main build in more leagues than I can remember. Tornado Shot isn\u2019t always the best build in any given league but in my opinion it\u2019s always the most comfy to play due to the fact it generally hits all the monsters on the screen no matter where you aim it! Historically it\u2019s a skill that gets nerfed frequently, let's hope that doesn\u2019t happen again any time soon!Which expansion has been your favourite so far?My Favorite Path of Exile Expansion is a toss up between Echoes of the Atlas and Legacy League.Echoes of the Atlas (Ritual League) was excellent as it took the concept of the Atlas of Worlds and expanded your ability to customize and interact with it greatly, creating a tonne of new ways to play.Legacy League was in many ways similar to Echoes of the Atlas but at a much earlier stage of games development, so it felt quite ahead of its time in what it offered especially when compared to other leagues at the time. The league allowed you to select empowered versions of past league mechanics to run on each of your maps via league stones but also featured Ancient Reliquary Keys!The Reliquary Keys opened a secret vault containing a chance at a pre-nerf version of some of the most powerful uniques in the game like pre-nerf Vessel of Vinktar which allowed you to instantly leech life from lightning damage (very overpowered). What really made the league fun is that the pre-nerf versions of uniques were incredibly rare but very powerful. It felt like I always had a goal to grind for and an upgrade to reach for in the Legacy League.What's one thing every Path of Exile player should hear?\u201cStill Sane Exile?\u201d - Zana Master Cartographer.P.S. When is Zana coming back?When did you first start streaming? How did you get into it?I first started streaming during the Legion league in 2019. The main reason I found myself streaming was people kept asking me to in my Youtube comments and Discord server so I figured I\u2019d give it a shot!What were you doing before you started streaming?Before I started content creation I worked as a business analyst at a large Australian company. Before that while I was going through my uni years I worked as a cleaner cleaning supermarkets which is actually a much tougher job than it sounds. If you\u2019re interested, the hardest thing to clean by far was the bakery.What hobbies or interests do you have outside of streaming?Right now outside of content creation and gaming my hobbies include working on and\ndeveloping my own Indie game for the PC and teaching myself how to draw. Pretty compelling stuff if you can get into it!How has your life changed from before you were streaming until now? What role has streaming played in that transition?Content creation as a whole has been something I\u2019ve been doing full time for a little over a year now and it\u2019s definitely much harder than I expected. Having the power to work whenever you want and make whatever you want is very freeing and a big change from what I used to do but also very difficult to manage. The role streaming plays for me is a tool to connect with my community, hang out, gather ideas and extend my reach when it counts (like on league start). Honestly I\u2019m still getting the hang of things and I tend to be pretty loosey-goosey with my schedule but I think I\u2019m starting to figure it out!Is there anything you'd like to see more of in the streaming community?Specifically in the Path of Exile streaming community I\u2019d personally love to see more entertainment based content. Path of Exile is a super serious game and a lot of the content made around it is very educational or competitive. Fun, light-hearted content whether it\u2019s a whacky build or a crazy crafting gamble are some of the most fun for me to watch.Do you have any advice for people who are looking to make their own career out of streaming?I\u2019m certainly no streaming or content creation guru but I\u2019ve seen my fair share of Path of Exile content creators rise through the ranks so I\u2019ll share what I\u2019ve seen work. Unless you\u2019re a God gamer intending to make a name for yourself by winning racing events or getting to level 100 first I\u2019d recommend starting on Youtube first and building a following there through solid, well-edited, informative or entertaining content.Releasing a hot league starter, or end game build is a pretty sure fire way to get people interested in what you have to say or are doing in the game and I\u2019ve seen plenty of people transition that into a successful streaming career. Jungroan[twitch.tv] (OP Hipster Meme Builds) and Palsteron[twitch.tv] (EA Ballista) are the two freshest in my mind.Are there any up and coming streamers that you'd like to shine a spotlight on?Certainly, I\u2019ll take the time to shout out my friend and fellow content creator crouching_tuna[twitch.tv]. He makes some seriously strong and interesting builds and is best known for his takes on Lightning Strike and more recently Blade Vortex. Definitely check him out if you haven\u2019t already!Do you plan to come to New Zealand for Exilecon? If so, is there anything outside of Exilecon that you're keen on checking out?Absolutely, I wouldn\u2019t miss it! Well not a second time that is\u2026 I really regret not attending the first one so I made it a point to be there for the second one!As I\u2019ve already been to New Zealand for a holiday before, I'll be spending my time outside of Exilecon hanging out with other creators and friends attending the convention and hopefully finding some good places to eat some delicious food.Thank you so much for participating in the interview!

That is until you realize the game is designed to waste your time and milk the supple teat of \"optional\"micro transactions. Save yourself from hours of trivial game play and painful learning by playing some good old D2. Chris Wilson would love to call every new league a fresh lick of paint but there is layer upon layer to the point where the fence has become an indistinguishable mass of slop. Lately the new content feels rushed, lazy and uninspired, I used to love this game but I have come to terms that it is not the project it once was 4 years ago. I would not recommend this game to anyone.\nMagician\n97 products in account\n0\nScreenshot\nAward\n28\n0\n15\nMonokuma\nDead Tulip\nView screenshots\nGuide\nPath of Exile - Historia\nFragmentos de Wraeclast - Em andamento...15%\n28 ratings\n0\n9\nAsta\nView all guides\nScreenshot\nAward\n28\n0\n1\n\uff86\uff7a\uff6f\nRX-10\nView screenshots\nScreenshot\nAward\n25\n0\n2\nBaldman\nView screenshots\nScreenshot\nAward\n24\n0\n10\n((((Semyon The Great))))\nView screenshots\n8 people found this review helpful\t\t\t\t1\nNot Recommended\n300.5 hrs on record\nPosted: 18 December\n8 years ago, I would have recommended this game. What went wrong? In short, the developers decided to balance the content around the top 0.001% of players and streamers. This means the major selling point of the game (build diversity) died bit by bit. Early after open beta, you could use almost any skill, play in almost any way and do well. Right now? Maybe 1 in a hundred skills is usable for clearing the endgame. And if you're a new player? Look up a guide, follow it TO THE LETTER or don't even bother.\nAs far as other problems with the game, a big one is gambling. Let's say I want a decent amulet (+1 to skills), how difficult is this? Well, it's about a 1 in 3000 chance if you use alterations. Alts are pretty common; I've got maybe 50 hours in the current league and I've found a thousand or so. The process of enchanting this amulet is: sit there, right click, look at stats, repeat. Do this for an hour or more. And then if you want to turn this decent item into an actually good item? The odds are <1%. 99% chance of bricking it (making it unusable) and having to start over.\nThis is what the entire crafting system is like: it's all gambling, it all requires outrageous amounts of currency, it's all frustrating and mandatory if you want to see the endgame.\nAnother problem is information, or rather the lack thereof. Want to see what \"Elemental proliferation\" actually means? Want to learn what the difference between \"increased damage\" and \"more damage\" is? Better open up the wiki. In fact, you'll have to open up 5-10 tabs and constantly switch between them and the game. Because NONE of this is explained in-game. That 1 in 3000 chance for a +1skill? That's never mentioned in game. In fact, the odds are so low you may not even be aware a +1 mod for amulets exists if you don't look up a guide.\nLastly, monetization. This game is \"free\" in the sense that you can start playing. But once you get to the \"real game\" (maps), you will be drowned in so many currencies and items that the game becomes essentially unplayable without paying for stash tabs. The developers intentionally made the player experience awful to force players to spend money on fixing a problem that didn't need to exist.\nSilver\n83 products in account\n0\n6 people found this review helpful\t\t\t\t2\nNot Recommended\n1,270.6 hrs on record\nPosted: 14 December\nGreat Game itself with a lot of things to learn, while it is not beginner friendly at all.I would say after experiencing all the changes in the last 2 years i wouldn't recommend poe unless you have a lot of freetime.One of the reasons i started getting addicted to poe were all the fun unique zoom zoom or completely broken builds i could play. Unfortunately in GGGs mind is it to make the game like a second job and removing the fun parts of the game to make it even grindier than it already was.\nKyrosaki\n26 products in account\n0\nVideo\n19\n0\n3\nPath of Exile: Buffing like as Ainz Ooal Gown\nMakesi\nView videos\nArtwork\nAward\n6\n0\n0\nBetter than a mirror.\n\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd37Lost soul\ud83d\udd37\ud83d\udd39\nView artwork\nGuide\n\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0432 3.20 (\u0441\u043e\u0444\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440)\n\u0412\u0441\u0451 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043b\u043e\u0433\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0438 (\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044b \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438). \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e.\n1\n2\nDangerous\nView all guides\nGuide\n\u0442\u043e\u043f \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0434 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430\n\u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0433\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435 \u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0434 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c\u044e \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435 10 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432\n1\n9\nNigma.Hipi_man\nView all guides\nArtwork\nAward\n5\n0\n0\n...\nMindless Prey\nView artwork\nArtwork\nAward\n4\n0\n0\nPoE\nMindless Prey\nView artwork\nArtwork\nAward\n2\n0\n0\nAI\nK4LID\nView artwork\nReally bad QOL\nWhy can't we have some kind of system that let me use all/some of my flask with 1 key press? or use more than 1 spells (at the same location, I am not suggesting we can auto target or anything) . it doesn't make me stronger it is just more QOL accessibility.\nIt is way to much to keep track of all the flask and use them while run around and using spells......\n41\nLord GabeN\n19 minutes ago\nGeneral Discussions\nArtwork\nAward\n1\n0\n0\nLul\nALASZLO\nView artwork\nVideo\n1\n0\n0\nPath of Exile BleedBow vs Maven Influenced Uber Elder Awakener 9\nIwan0129\nView videos\nVideo\n1\n0\n0\nPath of Exile 3.19 \u2013 3.20\n\u0411\u0438\u043b\u0434 \u043d\u0430 5 Way Carry Kinetic Blast, 10000+ kills.
